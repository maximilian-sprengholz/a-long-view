  abstract = {Data on stocks and flows of international migration are necessary to understand migrant patterns and trends and to monitor and evaluate migration-relevant international development agendas. Many countries do not publish data on bilateral migration flows. At least six methods have been proposed recently to estimate bilateral migration flows between all origin-destination country pairs based on migrant stock data published by the World Bank and United Nations. We apply each of these methods to the latest available stock data to provide six estimates of five-year bilateral migration flows between 1990 and 2015. To assess the resulting estimates, we correlate estimates of six migration measures from each method with equivalent reported data where possible. Such systematic efforts at validation have largely been neglected thus far. We show that the correlation between the reported data and the estimates varies widely among different migration measures, over space, and over time. We find that the two methods using a closed demographic accounting approach perform consistently better than the four other estimation approaches.},

Although effects vary across countries, the growth in female employment stalled, as did the rebound in fertility rates, divorce rates went up, while child income poverty increased further. The economic crisis also affected family policy. In many countries, income support policies initially expanded but after the onset of the crisis cutbacks to government spending were often made in view of budgetary pressures. In many countries, financial supports for families are less generous now than they were prior to the crisis. By comparison, parental leave arrangements and childcare supports systems have remained largely unscathed in most OECD countries with some countries actually expanding childcare supports despite the limitations to fiscal space. This paper highlights the changes in important family outcomes and related policies that occurred in OECD countries following the onset of the economic crisis, and demonstrates how countries most affected by the crisis faced significantly worse outcomes for families and children.},

With regard to marriage we focus on the determinants of intermarriage, the stability of these unions, and the timing of union formation. Marriage propensities are embedded in the cultural background of migrants and, hence, the capacity to form and maintain exogamous unions (between a foreign- and a native-born) can be interpreted as a strong sign of successful integration. Similarly, union dissolution among immigrants has important policy implications because of the likely vulnerability of immigrant women and their children, since women are less established in the labor force and more at risk of poverty than men. Next we review a set of mechanisms that may explain the fertility behavior of first-generation immigrants\textemdash namely selection, disruption, and adaptation. While all three mechanisms can be present concurrently, age at immigration influences their relative importance as it impacts when in her life-cycle a woman migrates as well as her ability to become proficient in the local language and understand the local norms.

We complement data from the European Labour Force Survey (2005-2015), with information about the skills contained in the jobs held by women, using data from the O*Net. In particular, we focus on analytical and strength skills in immigrant's jobs and compare them to those required by jobs held by similar native women. Even though immigrants experience upon arrival a gap in participation relative to the native born, they gradually increase participation during the first ten years spent in the country (approximately, 1\% per year in Spain, Italy and the UK, and 2\% and 4 \% per year in France and Sweden respectively). Our results reveal significant differences across countries of origin as well as differences within countries over the period of analysis. Recent immigrant women show relatively large gaps in the analytical skill content of the jobs they held relative to native-born women across our host countries. Further, with the exception of immigrants to Spain, they also work jobs with higher requirements of strength than their native-born counterparts do. Although educated immigrants show a different pattern in most countries (included Spain). We find differences within countries over the period of analysis that may be consistent with the variation of incentives to move depending on the business cycle at arrival - particularly given the meager opportunities in many destination countries during aftermath of the recent great recession.},

Does the income level of one individual regarding other members of the same household matter in personal income satisfaction? These two hypotheses are relevant to policy-making regarding subsidies, taxation and active labour market programmes. We use data for Spain and Denmark in the European Community Household Panel (ECHP). In general terms, and for both countries, our results seem to confirm both the procedural hypothesis and the relative income hypothesis. Labour income contributes more to individual financial satisfaction than non-labour income for both household partners (men and women) in the two countries. However, the effect of an individual's own share of labour income relative to the partner's differs considerably both between men and woman and between the two countries.},

Income inequality and an increasing social gap between immigrants and non-immigrants in Europe warrant further studies on the impact of socioeconomic factors on health in immigrant groups. The purpose of this study was to examine the association of socioeconomic status (SES) and emotional distress in women of Turkish descent and in women of German descent. Methods and Subjects A total of 405 women of German or Turkish descent residing in Berlin were interviewed. Emotional distress was assessed by the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), and SES was examined by level of education, employment status, and income. The associations of emotional distress and SES were estimated in multivariate linear regression analyses. Results Unemployment was associated with increased levels of emotional distress in all women, with the highest level of distress in the group of unemployed Turkish women. The overall SES level was related to a greater level of emotional distress in Turkish women, but not in German women (-3.2, 95\%CI -5.9 \textendash{} -.5; p=.020 vs. -.8, 95\%CI -2.7 \textendash{} 1.2; p=.431). Further stratified analyses by relationship status revealed that the association of SES and emotional distress only remained significant among single women. Conclusion The impact of socioeconomic hardship appears to be complicated by social roles and expectations related to these. Further in-depth study of the complex nature of the interaction of social roles and socioeconomic position in female Turkish immigrants in Germany is needed to better understand differing risk patterns for emotional distress.},

In the study, the ICECAP-A capability questionnaire was modified to measure both functionings and capabilities and was completed by U.K.-based convenience sample of 943 people. Around one third of people reported CFD in at least one area of their life, most commonly in terms of their ``achievement.'' People were more likely to report CFD when they had a degree-level education and when they had impaired health. An additional finding was that capability varied more with education whereas functioning varied more with health status. This finding needs further examination, but it suggests that the choice of evaluative space may influence how priorities are set for public spending.},

In line with findings regarding gender gaps in labour market behaviour, recent female migrants are less active on labour market than their male counterparts, and we observe a clear motherhood penalty and fatherhood premium on the number of hours worked. Men and women show only marginal differences in their occupational statuses. Changes over time do not differ between men and women, indicating persistent gender inequality in labour market attainment. Moreover, interesting differences between the nationalities were found. Polish migrants show the highest activity levels and lowest occupational status, also when compared to Bulgarians. Spanish migrants hold the highest occupational statuses.

However, the available empirical literature for Germany defined the groups in consideration, immigrants and natives, by citizenship. This limits the explanatory power of the estimates since citizenship distinguishes foreigners and German nationals, but assigns naturalised immigrants (including the large group of ethnic Germans) to the latter group. Providing a more adequate definition based on the concept of origin we analyse the immigrant-native wage gap. Based on data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study,we decompose the wage gap between native Germans, foreigners, and naturalised immigrants, and consider further subgroups in the analysis. In the literature, time of residence has been proven to be a relevant determinant of immigrants' wages. For the natives, time of residence is perfectly collinear with age, and unequal sets of variables have to be considered.We therefore suggest an extension of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition technique. Our results show a substantial gap in earnings for all immigrants' groups compared to natives. Discarding immigrants who completed education abroad reduces much of the immigrants' wage gap. Hence, educational attainment in Germany is an important component of economic integration of immigrants, and degrees obtained abroad are valued less.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new methodology for multidimensional poverty measurement consisting of an identification method {$\rho$}k that extends the traditional intersection and union approaches, and a class of poverty measures M{$\alpha$}. Our identification step employs two forms of cutoff: one within each dimension to determine whether a person is deprived in that dimension, and a second across dimensions that identifies the poor by `counting' the dimensions in which a person is deprived. The aggregation step employs the FGT measures, appropriately adjusted to account for multidimensionality. The axioms are presented as joint restrictions on identification and the measures, and the methodology satisfies a range of desirable properties including decomposability. The identification method is particularly well suited for use with ordinal data, as is the first of our measures, the adjusted headcount ratio M0. We present some dominance results and an interpretation of the adjusted headcount ratio as a measure of unfreedom. Examples from the US and Indonesia illustrate our methodology.},

  abstract = {Multidimensional measures provide an alternative lens through which poverty may be viewed and understood. In recent work we have attempted to offer a practical approach to identifying the poor and measuring aggregate poverty (Alkire and Foster, J Public Econ, 2011). As this is quite a departure from traditional unidimensional and multidimensional poverty measurement\textemdash particularly with respect to the identification step\textemdash further elaboration may be warranted. In this paper we elucidate the strengths, limitations, and misunderstandings of multidimensional poverty measurement in order to clarify the debate and catalyse further research. We begin with general definitions of unidimensional and multidimensional methodologies for measuring poverty. We provide an intuitive description of our measurement approach, including a `dual cutoff' identification step that views poverty as the state of being multiply deprived, and an aggregation step based on the traditional FGT measures. We briefly discuss five characteristics of our methodology that are easily overlooked or mistaken and conclude with some brief remarks on the way forward.},

This extends the methodological toolkit presented in Chapter 5. The chapter first presents a new measure of inequality among the poor and its axiomatic justification. The same measure, a form of variance, can be extended to analyse horizontal inequalities, which are disparities across different population subgroups. The next two sections provide methodological extensions that are required for intertemporal analysis of poverty using repeated cross-sectional data, and for the analysis of dynamic subgroups. The last section elaborates a measure chronic multidimensional poverty, which uses a counting approach both across dimensions and across periods, and provides its consistent partial indices, including a new statistic on the duration of poverty.},

  abstract = {The adjusted headcount ratio M0 of Alkire and Foster (2011a) is increasingly being adopted by countries and international organizations to measure poverty. Three properties are largely responsible for its growing use: Subgroup Decomposability, by which an assessment of subgroup contributions to overall poverty can be made, facilitating regional analysis and targeting; Dimensional Breakdown, by which an assessment of dimensional contributions to overall poverty can be made after the poor have been identified, facilitating coordination; and Ordinality, which ensures that the method can be used in cases where variables only have ordinal meaning. Following Sen (1976), a natural question to ask is whether sensitivity to inequality among the poor can be incorporated into this multidimensional framework. We propose a Dimensional Transfer axiom that applies to multidimensional poverty measures and specifies conditions under which poverty must fall as inequality among the poor decreases. An intuitive transformation is defined to obtain multidimensional measures with desired properties from unidimensional FGT measures having analogous properties; in particular, Dimensional Transfer follows from the standard Transfer axiom for unidimensional measures. A version of the unidimensional measures yields the M-gamma class containing the multidimensional headcount ratio for {$\gamma$} = 0, the adjusted headcount ratio M0 for {$\gamma$} = 1, and a squared count measure for {$\gamma$} = 2, satisfying Dimensional Transfer. Other examples show the ease with which measures can be constructed that satisfy Subgroup Decomposability, Ordinality, and Dimensional Transfer. However, none of these examples satisfies Dimensional Breakdown. A general impossibility theorem explains why this is so: Dimensional Breakdown is effectively inconsistent with Dimensional Transfer. Given the importance of Dimensional Breakdown for policy analysis, we suggest maintaining the adjusted headcount ratio as a central measure, augmented by the squared count measure or other indices that capture inequality among the poor. The methods are illustrated with an example from Cameroon.},

Building on the existing literature, fascinating questions remain in terms of measurement design (the selection of dimensions, indicators, cutoffs, and weights), the analysis of multidimensional poverty measures, their application to child poverty and their implementation using gendered data.

Contrary to expectations, we find that wage dispersion in the lower half of the income distribution does not affect household poverty. We then show that the main determinant of poverty reduction is social spending on the non-aged. These results suggest that the main way in which states affect poverty via social policy is through the tax and transfer system, and that market income poverty is primarily the result of factors affecting volume of work and remuneration levels at the bottom of the distribution.},

Using data from Spain, where the immigrant population has risen from 4\% to 13\% within a decade, we find that immigration appears to have affected the task specialization of natives without affecting their employment levels. However, the impact of immigration on the relative task supply of natives is twice as great in Spain as in the United States. The magnitude of the immigration impact in a country with a large share of immigrants originating from Spanish-speaking countries suggests that host country language proficiency is not the sole factor driving the observed impact. Additionally, the analysis reveals significant gender differences in the impact of immigration on the relative task supply of natives, possibly resting on the occupational concentration of immigrants and native occupational segregation patterns by gender, among other factors.},

Second, do the effects of personal characteristics and job location on underemployment vary by ethnicity? Data are drawn from the Annual Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement File of the 2005 Current Population Survey (CPS). Using multinomial logistic regression models, we show that ethnicity matters in the likelihood of working poverty but not for the other forms of underemployment. Results also reveal that the effects of personal attributes and job location on the likelihood of unemployment, involuntary part-time employment, and working poverty vary for each ethnic group, leading to a double disadvantage for working poor Mexican-origin women.},

Indeed Sen's arguments (see Sen, 1995) \textemdash{} that welfare and inequality, when measured in terms of functionings and capabilities, is intrinsically a many dimensioned thing \textemdash{} are equally pertinent for poverty measurement. When confined to the single variable paradigm the measurement and testing of poverty states has prompted many questions: `What variable should be employed (income or consumption)?', `What should the poverty cut-off point be?', `How should the variable be transformed (incidence, depth or intensity formulations)?', `Should we use permanent or transitory concepts?'. These issues are both diminished and compounded in magnitude when we move to a multidimensional paradigm: to some extent, variable choice becomes less of a problem (if in doubt include as much as possible), but how the combination of the factors in defining what would be a poverty boundary and the extent of poverty it delimits presents a whole new set of questions.},

Second, we measure the impact on poverty of the increasing gap by producing estimates of the income distribution for the subsequent years had the wage gap remained at the low level it used to be in the early 1990s. As mainly low-skilled women suffered from the increase in the wage gap, we find that the phenomenon contributed to an overall increase in poverty during the decade.},

I also suggest that it is the ways in which difference is fixed and marked which constitute the problem of modern society, rather than heterogeneity as such.

This paper proposes a novel decomposition of changes in multidimensional poverty, as measured by the basic members of the Alkire\textendash Foster family of measures. The method works for any type of dataset; and, in the case of panel datasets, it is useful for relating changes in these Alkire\textendash Foster measures to transitions into and out of multidimensional poverty.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The decomposition techniques are illustrated with the Young Lives panel dataset comprising cohorts of children from Ethiopia, Andhra Pradesh, Peru and Vietnam. Changes in the adjusted headcount ratio are decomposed into changes in the multidimensional headcount and changes in the average number of deprivations among poor people. Each of the latter is further decomposed into changes in relevant statistics including the probabilities of moving into and out of multidimensional poverty.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}This paper is one initial attempt to build a bridge between the literatures of poverty dynamics and multidimensional poverty measures. These have developed substantially but separately, for a long time. The underlying motivation is a question whether it is possible to analyse multidimensional poverty dynamics in a way that is conceptually meaningful, empirically informative, and useful for policy decisions. While we believe that much more work needs to be done in this direction, we hope that this paper provides some ideas and examples of what could be accomplished.},

  abstract = {This book puts forward an operational methodology for measuring multidimensional poverty, independent from the conceptual origin, size and qualitative as well as quantitative nature of the primary indicators used to describe the poverty of an individual, household or socio-demographic entity. It allows for the integration of the sets of techniques already available or forthcoming in the area of income poverty into the analysis of multidimensional poverty. The core of the methodology rests on a solution to the issue of aggregation across the multiple sub-dimensions of poverty. The rationale of the proposed solution is based on the exploration of the internal structure of association between these sub-dimensions of poverty. The author illustrates the conceptual debates on the dimensions of poverty and on the measurement methodologies with empirical studies showing the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches by dividing the book into two parts. The first part, which is theoretical, develops the rationale underlying the proposed methodology with numerical examples. The second part presents two case studies, one from Vietnam and the other from Senegal, using the methodology outlined in the first part. Both case studies are based on large household surveys implemented by the different national statistical offices. The unique structure of this book makes it practical for use by poverty and policy researchers, professionals in international development, and graduate students interested in poverty and inequality.},

  abstract = {In this paper, I take Capital in the Twenty-First Century by Thomas Piketty as the starting point for a set of twelve policy proposals that could bring about a genuine shift in the distribution of income towards less inequality. In designing the set of proposals, I draw on the experience of reducing inequality in postwar Europe and on an analysis as to how the economic circumstances are now different in the twenty-first century, highlighting the role of technical change and the rise in capital emphasized by Piketty. The proposed measures span many fields of policy, and are not confined to fiscal redistribution, encompassing science policy, competition policy, public employment, a guaranteed return on small savings, a capital endowment, as well as more progressive taxation of income and wealth transfers, and a participation income. Inequality is embedded in our social structure, and the search for a significant reduction requires us to examine all aspects of our society. I focus on inequality within countries, and what can be achieved by national governments, with the UK specifically in mind. The primary audience is those concerned with policy-making in national governments, but implementation should not be seen purely in these terms. There are different levels of government, and certain proposals, particularly those concerned with taxation, may only be feasible if pursued by a group of countries in collaboration. The last of the twelve proposals \textendash{} for a basic income for children \textendash{} is specifically directed at the European Union. Finally, actions by individuals as consumers, as workers, or as employers, can all contribute to reducing inequality.},

This paper is based on a qualitative study (Part of the fieldwork was undertaken with Dr. T. Fossland, University of Troms\o.) of highly skilled immigrants in Troms\o, Norway, undertaken while migrants attended the Global Future talent mobilisation programme. It builds on migrant narratives and observations, showing both women and men migrate for non-work reasons \textendash{} often marriage or love. While previous studies focused on women as dependent migrants and described the `de-skilling' of highly skilled migrants during migration, this study addresses the mechanisms which make entering labour markets a problem, prior to the deskilling, for men and women. Acknowledging that love migration is grounded in processes outside the labour market, and that migrants enter a specific local labour market, I employ a contextual perspective focused on gender and place. Theories on the transfer of skills are added to understand the processes of accessing and exclusion from skilled labour markets. The study finds gendered expectations and norms affect both women and men's participation in labour markets. It shows how both the scale and structure of a local labour market are important in understanding exclusion processes and that going beyond language proficiency, localised knowledge and access to local non-migrant networks seem necessary to make skills relevant. These findings strengthen our understanding of migrants' exclusion, and the spatial, social and cultural embeddedness of skills.},

First, this work compares immigrants and natives in order to understand whether, and to what extent, in a country characterized overall by low social mobility, natives and migrants have the same chances for improving their social position, or the latter are disadvantaged on an ethnic basis that affects their career (research question 1). Then, the article investigates what are the factors (referring to immigrants' human capital, socio-cultural assimilation process and ethnic network) fostering occupational mobility among immigrants (research question 2). We conduct an ordinary least squares analysis on microdata from two retrospective cross-sectional surveys, for natives and migrants, with the same sample design, questionnaire structure and variable classification, thereby allowing the comparison of results. The empirical findings confirm that intra-generational occupational mobility in Italy is overall very limited but that geographical origin is a significant factor influencing upward mobility. Thus, the existence of an ethnic penalty is confirmed. Furthermore, among migrants, high human capital improves (short-range) upward mobility, while the socio-cultural assimilation process only partly leads to economic assimilation. Conversely, the recourse to the ethnic network acts as a trap in low-qualified occupational careers, hindering an improvement of socio-economic position.},

Previous analyses of the dynamics of poverty have either examined only fluctuations in the male heads earnings or looked at the frequency of poverty periods over a fixed time frame. We argue that a more appropriate way to understand the dynamics of poverty is to define spells of poverty. Using this methodology we find that the majority of poor persons at any point in time are in fact in the midst of a rather long spell of poverty. The methodology also allows us to estimate the extent to which poverty spell beginnings and endings are associated with changes in income or changes in family structure. Less than 40 percent of poverty spell beginnings seem to be caused by a drop in the heads earnings,while 60 percent of endings occur when the head's earnings increase. As a result we argue that to understand the causes and potential remedies for poverty, researchers must focus on household formation decisions and on the behavior of so called secondary family members.},

Qualitative interview data highlights the subtle, implicit relationship between dependent applicant status, traditional gender roles, and employment integration. In most cases, the women are designated as the dependent applicant during the immigration process because they have lower levels of the human capital that is valued for Canadian immigration than their husbands. Our findings suggest that within newly immigrated families, principal applicants are better able to reestablish their careers, while dependent applicants, disproportionately women, face more employment disadvantage, regardless of their professional background.},

We examine the patterns of variation in the immigrant\textendash native poverty gap between and within countries. We simultaneously combine characteristics of households from the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions and some key country-specific factors, distinguishing among mixed and non-mixed immigrant households and natives. The main findings for 2012 reveal that immigrants, especially non-mixed immigrant households, are exposed to a higher risk of poverty than natives, though this gap varies across countries. We find evidence of significant household-level effects, but the contribution of country-level variables to explain cross-country differences in the poverty gap is substantially higher. Concerning household characteristics, employment and being young have less effect (positive and negative, respectively) on immigrants than on natives, while each additional child has a more negative effect. Education seems to have a lower effect on the likelihood of being poor for non-mixed immigrant households than for natives and owning a house reduces this likelihood more for non-mixed immigrant households. In terms of country-level factors, labour market and social benefits seem to be equally important for both natives and immigrants. We also compare the results in 2012 with those for 2007 to check for possible changes over time related to the influence of the economic cycle on the poverty gap and/or on the importance of household- and country-level factors.},

We find that when the number of immigrants who provide household services is higher, native Italian women spend more time at work (intensive margin) without affecting their labour force participation (extensive margin). This impact is concentrated on highly skilled women whose time has a higher opportunity cost. These results also hold after a battery of robustness checks. We present some further evidence that is also consistent with the idea that the impact works through substitution in household work rather than complementarities in the production sector. Finally, we show that immigration arises as a substitute to publicly provided welfare services, although this phenomenon raises concerns regarding the fairness and sustainability of this private and informal welfare model.},

In this paper, we use data from a nationally representative sample of immigrants and natives drawn in 2005 to assess the occupational attainment of immigrants in Ireland relative to natives. It is found that immigrants, on average, are less likely to be in high-level occupations controlling for factors such as age and education. When looked at by year of arrival, it appears as if immigrants who arrived more recently have lower occupational attainment relative to earlier arrivals, thereby suggesting a process of integration. However, a closer analysis shows that the observation of better occupational attainment for earlier arrivals can be explained by a change in the national origin mix of Ireland's immigrants, with immigrants from the New Member States of the European Union having the lowest occupational attainment. Within national groups there is generally no clear evidence of improved occupational attainment over time.},

  abstract = {Over the past 20 years, the social protection measures devoted to unemployed people in Europe have become more diverse. In an attempt to complement or curb cash transfers, many countries have put measures, services in kind and activation policies at the centre of social protection against unemployment. This article compares two countries with different policies: Spain, which still has very `traditional' unemployment support with little emphasis on activation, and Germany, where there has in recent years been rapid change towards activation measures. The article evaluates these policies and their consequences on the unemployed by means of the capability model, investigating comparatively the effects of institutional intervention on the real set of options available to the unemployed in finding a decent job or pursuing training or other activities. The authors argue that cash transfers can increase capabilities `by default', whereas more intervention-oriented public employment services need to give unemployed workers an active part in `tailoring' supports to their needs., En Europe, au cours de ces 20 derni\`eres ann\'ees, les mesures de protection sociale destin\'ees aux ch\^omeurs ont connu une diversification croissante. Pour tenter de compl\'eter ou de r\'eduire les transferts d'argent, de nombreux pays ont plac\'e des mesures, des services en nature et des politiques d'activation au coeur de la protection sociale contre le ch\^omage. Cet article compare deux pays menant des politiques diff\'erentes: l'Espagne, qui conna\^it toujours un soutien tr\`es \guillemotleft{} traditionnel \guillemotright{} en faveur des ch\^omeurs et met peu l'accent sur l'activation, et l'Allemagne, qui a connu ces derni\`eres ann\'ees un changement rapide en faveur des mesures d'activation. L'article \'evalue ces politiques et leurs cons\'equences sur les ch\^omeurs au moyen du mod\`ele des capacit\'es, en \'etudiant dans une perspective comparative les effets de l'intervention institutionnelle sur l'\'eventail des options r\'eellement disponibles aux ch\^omeurs pour trouver un emploi d\'ecent, pour suivre une formation ou pour mener d'autres activit\'es. Les auteurs indiquent que les transferts d'argent peuvent accro\^itre les capacit\'es \guillemotleft{} par d\'efaut \guillemotright{} alors que les services publics de l'emploi davantage ax\'es sur l'orientation doivent donner aux travailleurs sans emploi un r\^ole actif pour que les soutiens apport\'es soient davantage \guillemotleft{} taill\'es sur mesure \guillemotright, en fonction de leurs besoins., In den vergangenen zwanzig Jahren haben sich die sozialen Sicherungen f\"ur Arbeitslose in Europa ausdifferenziert.

Dieser Artikel vergleicht zwei L\"ander, deren politische Strategien sich unterscheiden: Spanien erbringt vor allem ``traditionelle'' Lohnersatzleistungen und verfolgt kaum aktivierende Ans\"atze, wogegen Deutschland in den letzten Jahren rasch auf einen Aktivierungskurs einschwenkte. Dieser Artikel nutzt das Modell der Verwirklichungschancen (``capabilities''), um diese politischen Strategien und ihre Wirkungen f\"ur die Arbeitslosen zu evaluieren.

The paper is based on a comparative assessment of available quantitative data and qualitative information derived from a broad review of findings from previous studies in the literature. Our quantitative evaluation includes the European OECD countries, while our qualitative investigation addresses migrant entrepreneurship experiences in eight European countries: Denmark, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, and the UK. The results of our comparative analysis show that the general picture of European migrant entrepreneurship is determined by some distinct push factors such as high unemployment rates and low participation rates or low status in the labour market as well as by an accompanying factor, namely mixed embeddedness. The results of our comparative evaluation are summarized in a systematic typological table. These show that, while an informal and labour-intensive sector, an underground economy, and small companies and traditional households prompt migrant entrepreneurship in Southern European countries, an over-representation of non-Western immigrants among the self-employed, as well as relatively lower income levels of self-employed immigrants compared to both self-employed natives and employed immigrants are decisive for migrant entrepreneurship in Northern European countries.},

Means-tested benefits, as social assistance or housing benefits, are designed as safeguards against poverty for the low-income strata of the population, but our knowledge on their impact is fairly limited.

How large is the impact of means-tested transfers in private household budgets, and how does the role of means-tested benefits vary across countries? This article uses the household data of the Luxembourg Income Study to explore the effectiveness of means-tested programmes in terms of poverty alleviation in Britain, Germany and Sweden in the early 1990s. The results of this analysis show a considerable variation in the degree means-tested benefits can actually protect people from poverty. A comparison of household income before and after means-tested benefits exhibits different patterns of poverty alleviation. Using four relative poverty lines (30 percent, 40 percent, 50 percent and 60 percent of median household income adjusted for family size), this piece of research illustrates that there is considerable variation in the degree people are lifted up the income scale by means-tested benefits.},

When the Great Recession hit, the number of hours of those who said they wanted more hours increased, and the number of hours of those who said they wanted fewer hours decreased. The percentage of workers in both categories remains elevated. The authors provide evidence for the United Kingdom and the United States as well as from an international sample that underemployment lowers pay in the years after the Great Recession, but the unemployment rate does not. They also find evidence for the United States that decreases in the home ownership rate have helped to keep wage pressure in check.

It discusses major questions addressed, including inequalities between (gendered) individuals and the potential reasons for these. It outlines significant developments and debates, within qualitative research in particular, in relation to the unit of analysis (traditionally, the married couple), the texture and meaning of financial dealings within couples, and the tensions between autonomy and equal sharing as values. It then discusses several key methodological challenges, and concludes by highlighting some policy implications of central research messages. Throughout, it draws on and discusses the other articles in this special section, which explore key methodological issues in researching within-household distribution.},

However, cross-national variation in levels of internal migration remains poorly understood, because it is analysed almost exclusively using cross-sectional data and period measures. This paper seeks to advance understanding of cross-national variation in migration levels in 14 European countries by drawing on a recently proposed suite of migration cohort measures, coupled with internationally comparable retrospective residential histories. It shows that differences in migration levels are mainly attributable to variation in the extent of repeat movement, which is underpinned by the differences in mean ages at first and last move that together delineate the average length of migration careers. Cohort analysis provides a robust foundation for exploring the demographic mechanisms underpinning variation in migration levels across countries and over time.},

We use data from the Spanish labour force surveys for the years between 2002 and 2007 and compare the probability of being active versus inactive and that of being employed versus unemployed among immigrants and native-born Spaniards, using logistic regression models. The paper then moves on to investigate the quality of the occupation achieved by means of multinomial logistic regression models. We find evidence that immigrants are not at a disadvantage in comparison to native-born Spaniards regarding the risk of unemployment. This is true even after controlling for differences in socio-demographic characteristics between immigrants and Spaniards and, in particular, after accounting for the duration of time spent in the labour market. On the other hand, a strong and persistent disadvantage even after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics is confirmed for immigrants as far as their access to skilled occupations is concerned. Furthermore, this disadvantage does not disappear as time spent in the host country increases. Our findings, thus, go against the assimilation hypothesis that predicts that immigrant's occupational attainment should progressively converge to that of natives.},

Our results show some remarkable differences in employment patterns. Controlling for educational level, partnership and the presence of children, it was found that native women more often work in part-time jobs than ethnic minority women. For native Dutch women, the number of children influences both the employment decision and the number of hours worked, whereas for ethnic minority women, this only effects full-time employment.},

Further, in countries where a high share of women permanently withdraw from the labor force after childbirth, the size of gender differences in unemployment strongly correlates with the Eurobarometer measure of perceived overall gender discrimination. Our findings suggest that family leave policies and institutions that facilitate the leave to work transition and the work-family balance are crucial to tackle the gender differences in unemployment in countries where the female unemployment rate exceeds that of men.},

This has implications for the ability of women, particularly, to manage financial decisions in the face of their partner's illness, or widowhood, as well as for their autonomy and well-being. We analyse in depth qualitative data from forty-five older couples across the socio-economic spectrum to show that women have varying emotional responses to money management in coupledom: `accepters' who accept financial inequality and dominance by their husbands, `resenters' who recognise these inequalities but resent them, and `modifiers/resisters' who retain financial independence and power within their relationships. It is only the latter group, who have long histories of financial control and management, who are well placed for financial management and decisions in later life. By recognising the implications of different types of couple relationship, policies can be better designed to assist those navigating money in later life.},

  abstract = {Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) microdata over the 1980\textendash 2010 period, we provide new empirical evidence on the extent of and trends in the gender wage gap, which declined considerably during this time. By 2010, conventional human capital variables taken together explained little of the gender wage gap, while gender differences in occupation and industry continued to be important. Moreover, the gender pay gap declined much more slowly at the top of the wage distribution than at the middle or bottom and by 2010 was noticeably higher at the top. We then survey the literature to identify what has been learned about the explanations for the gap. We conclude that many of the traditional explanations continue to have salience. Although \-human-capital factors are now relatively unimportant in the aggregate, women's work force interruptions and shorter hours remain significant in high-skilled occupations, possibly due to compensating differentials. Gender differences in industries, as well as differences in gender roles and the gender division of labor remain important, and research based on experimental evidence strongly suggests that discrimination cannot be discounted. Psychological attributes or noncognitive skills comprise one of the newer explanations for gender differences in outcomes. Our effort to assess the quantitative evidence on the importance of these factors suggests that they account for a small to moderate portion of the gender pay gap, considerably smaller than, say, occupation and industry effects, though they appear to modestly contribute to these differences.

Next we examine key challenges faced by mothers as they seek to combine motherhood and paid work: workforce interruptions associated with childbearing, the impact of home and family responsibilities, and constraints posed by workplace culture. We also consider the role that gendered norms play in shaping outcomes for mothers. We conclude by discussing policies that have the potential to increase gender equality in the workplace and mitigate the considerable conflicts faced by many women as they seek to balance work and family.},

The apparent mismatch between proclaimed restrictive policy goals of `zero immigration' and the de facto reality that a considerable extent of legal immigration was nev- ertheless admitted year for year led scholars to deal with the question `why liberal states accept unwanted migration' Qoppke, 1998). Various explanations of this `gap' pointed towards an important paradox inher- ent within liberal democracies. On the one hand, migration might be undesired by a majority of the demos and the political class alike, not least since large-scale immigration might alter the composition of the members of the polity to a considerable extent. After all, is it not the normative prerogative of any democracy to be sovereign in determin- ing the rules according to which further members are admitted (Walzer, 1983)? However, liberal democracies are not only democratic but also liberal; an important part of their legitimacy and identity is, thus, derived from their adherence to a doctrine of rights-based liberalism. The pressure to grant some degree of individual rights to all members of society, regardless of their nationality, has been claimed to reduce liberal democratic governments' ability to truly inhibit migration.},

In this article, we empirically analyze income taxation and the choice of working hours by combining the collective approach for household behavior and the discrete hours choice framework with fixed costs of work. We identify the sharing rule parameters with data on working hours of both the husband and the wife within a couple. Parameter estimates are used to evaluate various model outcomes, like the wage elasticities of labor supply and the impacts of wage changes on the intrahousehold allocation of income. We also simulate the consequences of a policy change in the tax system. We find that the collective model has different empirical outcomes of income sharing than a restricted model that imposes income pooling. In particular, a specification with income pooling fails to capture asymmetries in the income sharing across spouses. These differences in outcomes have consequences for the evaluation of policy changes in the tax system and shed light on the effectiveness of certain policies.},

Denmark and Sweden share the same properties in a range of labour-market and welfare-state characteristics. At the same time, they differ very much in cyclical profiles and immigration experiences during recent decades. Both countries have followed the same principles regarding immigration policy, i.e. immigration from low-income countries has been restricted to tied movers and refugees. We use 60 percent of the median in the distribution of equivalent disposable income as the poverty line. Data comes from two large panels based on administrative data. We find that immigrants have higher poverty rates than natives in both countries and that this difference has clearly increased in both countries. The paper reports results based on running probability models of poverty incidence. Explanatory variables include years since immigration, demographic characteristics and country of origin. We conclude that a significant part of the difference in aggregate immigrant poverty rates reflects differences in composition by country of origin and differences in the structure of benefits to families with children.},

This paper shows that the banded income data is especially problematic for poverty analyses over time and thus requires a specific calculation routine. The simple usage of the midpoint of the income bands, however, carries the risk of producing statistical artefacts in time series which in turn lead to erroneous social political conclusions. This paper addresses these problems by presenting a SPSS syntax tool computing Stauder and H\"uning`s (2004) household specific poverty probabilities as the adequate calculation procedure.},

Access to the labour market is referred to as the main characteristic, which decides whether someone is .inside. or .outside.. Lots of theoretical and conceptual efforts have been undertaken to establish dimensions and characteristics of social exclusion, addressing processes of denied participation . socially, economically, politically or culturally. Nevertheless, poverty and social exclusion as two descriptions of severe social inequality have often been mixed up, and hypothesis about their interrelation and characteristics have hardly been tested empirically. Is poverty the first stage on the way .out of society., or are there considerable differences between the risk of becoming poor or socially excluded? In this contribution I propose the conceptualization and operationalization of social exclusion tendencies on the basis of the German Welfare Survey 1998. First of all, the multidimensionality of social exclusion is analysed to gain an insight into its structure. Of particular interest is the question how cumulative social disadvantages show their effect on perceived social exclusion in the view of the respondents. Furthermore, I concentrate on the relationship between poverty and social exclusion and compare the determinants of becoming poor and socially excluded.},

Across household types, single parents with children have the highest poverty risk.Most striking is a huge regional divide in poverty which only narrows slightly over the period under investigation: the incidence and the intensity of poverty are substantially higher in the New states. A nonlinear Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition is conducted to quantify the separate contribution of regional differences in households' characteristics to the likelhood of being poor. Estimates from the decomposition indicate that differences in the distributions of socioeconomic characteristics play a negligible role for the 1993 poverty divide. Already in year 2003, however, differences in the distributions of characteristics explain more than fifty percent of the poverty divide, indicating that the poverty divide is likely to become a persistent phenomenon.},

  abstract = {Researchers have long known that poverty in childhood is linked with a range of negative adult socioeconomic outcomes, from lower educational achievement and behavioral problems to lower earnings in the labor market. But few researchers have explored whether exposure to a disadvantaged background affects immigrant children and native children differently. George Borjas uses Current Population Survey (CPS) data on two specific indicators of poverty\textemdash the poverty rate and the rate of participation in public assistance programs\textemdash to begin answering that question. He finds that immigrant children have significantly higher rates both of poverty and of program participation than do native children. Nearly half of immigrant children are being raised in households that receive some type of public assistance, compared with roughly one-third of native children. Although the shares of immigrant and native children living in poverty are lower, the rate for immigrant children is nonetheless about 15 percentage points higher than that for native children\textemdash about the same as the gap in public assistance. Poverty and program participation rates among different groups of immigrant children also vary widely, depending in part on place of birth (foreign-or U.S.-born), parents (immigrant or native), and national origin. According to the CPS data, these native-immigrant differences persist into young adulthood. In particular, the program participation and poverty status of immigrant children is strongly correlated with their program participation and poverty status when they become young adults. But it is not possible, says Borjas, to tell whether the link results from a set of permanent factors associated with specific individuals or groups that tends to lead to "good" or "bad" outcomes systematically over time or from exposure during childhood to adverse socioeconomic outcomes, such as poverty or welfare dependency. Future research must explore the causal impact of childhood poverty on immigrant adult outcomes and why it might differ between immigrant and native families. Developing successful policies to address problems caused by the intergenerational breeding of poverty and program participation in the immigrant population depends on understanding this causal mechanism.},

Unlike many previous studies of this question, our work emphasizes the importance of identifying couples that have migrated together, rather than simply comparing long-distance (fe)male migrants with nonmigrant (fe)males individually. We demonstrate that women's employment status is harmed by family migration; the results we present are surprisingly consistent for Great Britain and the United States, despite differing economic situations and cultural norms regarding gender and migration. We also demonstrate that studies that fail to identify linked migrant couples are likely to underestimate the negative effects of family migration on women's employment status.},

Second, we consider selection effects and the role of state dependence in relation to women's employment status prior to moving.

It focuses on initiatives by UN Women, including the Progress of the World's Women 2015\textendash 16. Our analysis of the data compiled by UN Women raises questions about what might account for the over-representation of women among the poor in official accounts of poverty, and how this is plausibly changing (or not) over time. The paper highlights that analysis of what is measured and how needs to be understood in relation to who is the focus of measurement. The lack of available data which is fit for purpose questions the extent to which gender poverty differences are `real' or statistical. There is a continued reliance on comparing female with male headed households, and we argue the move by UN Women to adopt the notion of Female Only Households reflects available data driving conceptual understandings of women's poverty, rather than conceptual advances driving the search for better data. Wider UN processes highlight that while sensitivity to differences among women and their subjectivities are paramount in understanding the multiple processes accounting for gender bias in poverty burdens, they are still accorded little priority. To monitor advances in Agenda 2030 will require more and better statistics. Our review suggests that we are still far from having a set of tools able to adequately measure and monitor gendered poverty.},

With unbalanced panel analysis of 18 countries, two poverty measures and controlling for the welfare state and economic performance, I examine five structural factors: manufacturing employment, agricultural employment, female labor force participation, the elderly population, and children in single mother families. Manufacturing employment, female labor force participation, elderly population, and children in single mother families significantly influence the headcount measure of poverty, while agricultural employment is insignificant. By contrast, all five structural variables are insignificant for the interval measure of poverty. For the headcount, the structural variables have a more powerful influence than economic growth (the only significant indicator of economic performance) but a smaller influence than the welfare state. For the interval measure, the welfare state has a much larger influence than economic growth, and the insignificant structural and other economic variables. Counterfactual simulations are used to illustrate consequences of these effects for the U.S., Germany, and Sweden. Sensitivity analyses demonstrate the main conclusions hold regardless of the U.S. cases. Though structural variables influence one of the two poverty measures, the welfare state is most important to explaining poverty in rich Western democracies.},

There is significant heterogeneity between host countries, but in general, refugees experience persistently worse outcomes than other migrants.  While the gaps between the groups can be seen to decrease on a timescale of a decade or two, this is more pronounced in employment rates than it is in wages. We also  discuss how refugees are distinct in terms of other factors affecting integration, including health, language skills, and social networks. We provide a discussion of insights  for public policy in receiving countries, concluding that supporting refugees in early labor market attachment is crucial.},

The ordering criteria extend the power of earlier multidimensional dominance tests by making (reasonable) assumptions on the relative marginal contributions of each time dimension to poverty. Inter alia, this involves drawing on natural symmetry and asymmetry assumptions as well as on the mean/variability framework commonly used in the risk literature. The resulting procedures make it possible to check for the robustness of poverty comparisons to choices of intertemporal aggregation procedures and to areas of intertemporal poverty frontiers. The results are illustrated using a rich sample of 23 European countries over 2006\textendash 2009.},

We estimate that early legal access to oral contraception reduces female poverty by 0.5 percentage points, even when controlling for completed education, employment status, and household composition.},

Results are compared across seven European countries with contrasting family policies: the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, and Finland. Findings based on traditional research designs first indicate a strong positive effect of mothers' labor market participation on families' income situation in almost all countries and family types. By applying selectivity models, however, we show that a substantial part of this positive effect is caused by the fact that mothers in employment are a positively selected group. This implies that continuing policy measures to expand mothers' labor market participation - which are, nevertheless, strongly recommended - are likely to become less efficient as the work participation of mothers increases.},

The range of potential equivalence scales that can and are being used in the ten LIS countries and elsewhere to adjust incomes for size and related differences in need span a wide spectrum. The purpose of this paper is to review the available equivalence scales and to test the sensitivity of various income inequality and poverty measures to choice of equivalence scale using the LIS database. The results of our analysis indicate that choice of equivalence scale can sometimes systematically affect absolute and relative levels of poverty; and inequality and therefore rankings of countries (or population subgroups within countries). Because of these sensitivities, one must carefully consider summary statements and policy implications derived from cross-national comparisons of poverty and/or inequality.},

This paper focuses on the impact of institutions and redistributive policies on inequality and poverty with the view of assessing whether a trade-off between better labour market performance and equity has taken place in OECD countries, notably in the 1990s. During this period, reductions of unemployment have been associated with rising wage dispersion for workers in most OECD countries. Nevertheless, no clear general trend appears for total disposable income inequality and relative poverty among the total population. These developments suggest that gains from higher employment have in general offset the impact of rising wage dispersion. A preliminary econometric analysis for the period 1978- 2000 fails to detect any robust relationship between labour market institutions/policies and inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient.

The estimates indicate substantial scale economies of living together. Furthermore, wives receive on average almost 50 \% of household resources, but the estimated shares vary between 30 and 60 \%. Female resource shares increase with the ratio of female to male wages. Consumption inequality is underestimated by 16 \% if unequal sharing is ignored.},

  abstract = {A key task within the capability approach is the selection of relevant capabilities. The question of how to select capabilities has divided capability theorists into two camps: those who argue that it is a philosophical task and those who argue that it is a matter for the public. In this paper, I argue that this distinction between philosophy and democracy is counterproductive to the operationalization of the capability approach. On the one hand, proponents of the philosophical position overestimate the need for philosophical theorizing when selecting capabilities. On the other hand, proponents of the democratic positions can benefit from addressing issues raised by philosophers. I conclude that rather than making the philosophical position more democratically sensitive, we should search out ways in which philosophy can reinforce democratic processes in general and in relation to the selection of capabilities in particular.},

It highlights some of the key normative decisions that have to be taken, in particular, the role of compensation over time (whether poverty spells can be compensated for by non-poverty spells); the issue of the discount rate (whether each spell should be given an equal weight); and the issue of the role of persistence (whether repeated spells should be given a higher weight). It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation.},

Recent literature is crafting both analytical and empirical frameworks that will reshape our understanding of poverty as a multidimensional condition. Low consumption, below some minimal standard, is but one of the faces of poverty, and indeed the predicaments of the poor may be often due to some other forms of deprivation, such as disease, illiteracy, malnutrition, and also a sense of insecurity and defencelessness as they endeavour to survive in an environment characterized by uncertainty about the future. In this chapter we focus on this last component, and claim that such lack of `peace of mind' is a relevant form of deprivation, as argued for instance by Chambers (1989) and Narayan, Patel et al. (2000).},

Living arrangements also affect the optimal design of policies related to income support and child support. In this paper we briefly review changes in family structure and the relationship between family structure and employment, and then focus on policies that are essential to reducing poverty in the context of the current work-based safety net, in which low-income families with children rely increasingly on mothers' earnings. We argue that economically vulnerable families will benefit the most from policies that support resident parents' efforts to balance work and caretaking, and that support and enforce nonresident parents' contributions. We highlight key policies that help resident parents balance responsibilities, including support for access to child care and preschool, family-friendly workplace policies, and earnings supplements (e.g., the EITC). We also outline a set of policies designed to support and require nonresident parents' contributions, including reforms aimed at creating a child support enforcement system clearly focused on improving child well-being, rather than government cost recovery, and policies supporting nonresident parents' ability to work and pay support.},

The 1997 education reform in Turkey extended compulsory schooling from 5 to 8~years. Using the reform as a natural experiment, we investigate the impact of the reform on the effects of mothers' traditional views in determining children's educational attainment. We find that the reform helped reduce school dropout rates across the country. Nevertheless, regardless of the mother's view on gender roles, the reductions in school dropout rates were similar for boys and girls, failing to eliminate the gender gap against girls. Turkey is an excellent environment to study the effects of societal gender roles since it combines modernity with traditionalism and displays a wide spectrum of views on gender roles. It is also one of the few developing countries where a gender gap to the detriment of females still exists in educational achievement.},

We perform Fairlie decompositions to find that in Denmark, compared to Germany, a larger part of the native-immigrant poverty difference is explained by market valuation of characteristics and by unobservables. Finally, we decompose poverty by subgroups and find that certain immigrant subgroups (such as families with children and the elderly) are especially vulnerable in both countries and that not much has changed in the two countries between 2008 and 2013 in terms of the vulnerability of these sub-groups to poverty risk.},

  abstract = {While a number of studies explored the demographic and human capital attributes affecting migrant socio-economic assimilation, less is known about the role of immigration status on entry. In particular, little evidence exists on the employment outcomes of migrants admitted outside economic immigration channels (family, study, asylum or permit-free) and joining the labour market once in the country of destination. This paper addresses this knowledge gap. Its conceptual framework for understanding how immigration status on arrival influences access to the labour market highlights the role of selectivity mechanisms and of different rights and constraints characterizing the legal situation of migrants who enter via different admission routes. The empirical analysis builds on original estimates of the migrant workforce by immigration status on entry based on the 2008 Ad-Hoc Module of the EU Labour Force Survey. Logistic regressions show that immigration status on arrival affects the participation in the labour market, the probability of being unemployed and the access to a job commensurate to the migrant skills. While the participation of family migrants and refugees in the labour market is positively associated with their length of stay, these categories retain a significant unemployment disadvantage in almost all European destinations. This gap becomes particularly evident at the intersection of immigration status and gender. Results suggest the need for a more holistic approach to the governance of labour migration that takes into account the long-term trends of migrant labour supply.},

We also show that the gaps between the sexes, educational groups and countries grow even wider among women with children. Consequently, dual earnership is far from generalized in the OECD and differences in poverty rates may be explained by (among other factors) the uneven participation in paid labour of women. To counteract this phenomenon, we therefore plea for a welfare state reform towards the inclusion of care. This will ease the entry to paid employment for mothers and low-skilled women, and thus act as a poverty reduction strategy. A combination of several policy measures is suggested.},

An integrated decomposition of changes in the at-risk-of-poverty rates is presented on the basis of (i) changes in the poverty risks of jobless households, (ii) changes in the poverty risks of other (non-jobless) households, (iii) changes in household joblessness due to changes in individual employment rates and changing household structures and (iv) changes in polarization.},

We use the terms `voluntary' and `involuntary' to reflect the woman's choice in accepting to work in paid part-time employment. In this context, voluntary part-time work is not meant to be construed as charitable, non-paid activities, but rather is construed as individuals who are working part-time but who would prefer to be working full-time, if a suitable job were available. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Labor Market Experience (NLSLME), we found that labour market attachment characteristics added little to predict part-time employment status (involuntary vs. voluntary) and had virtually no effect on the odds of any other correlates on employment status. The major exception was number of years of unemployment. The longer working women were previously unemployed, the greater the likelihood they were involuntarily employed in part-time jobs. In addition, we found that marriage and private sector employment decreased the likelihood of involuntary part-time employment. Findings suggest that involuntarily part-time employed women appear to be `settling' for what they can get, namely, part-time rather than full-time jobs and that unmarried part-timers may be viewed as a stigmatized or marginal group more likely to be employed in the public rather than private sector. Policy implications and future research are discussed.},

This introductory article locates the three concepts within the development of migration scholarship.

Second, we examine the ways in which `aspiration' and `desire' have figured in migration theory. Sometimes treated as synonyms, the terms both belong to a broader semantic field of potentiality, yet connect with different theoretical approaches. Third, we address the rise of `drivers of migration' as an analytical concept, noting how it seems to be replacing `causes' and `determinants' in the literature.},

  abstract = {Person Equivalent Headcount Measures of Poverty* Headcount measures of poverty are by far the most common tools for evaluating poverty and gauging progress in global development goals. The headcount ratio, or the prevalence of poverty, and the headcount, or the number of the poor, both convey tangible information about poverty. But both ignore the depth of poverty, so they arguably present distorted views of the spatial distribution of poverty as well as the extent of progress against poverty over time. Additionally, headcount measures can provide incentives for policymakers and NGOs to focus their efforts on the least poor, an observation well understood among policymakers themselves. While other poverty measures mitigate these problems by capturing the intensity as well as the prevalence of poverty, they are often not central to policy discourse because they are perceived to be too ``unintuitive'' to have traction. There is a need for poverty measures that go beyond traditional headcount measures, but retain their direct interpretation. This paper presents person equivalent (p. e.) headcount measures, which do just that. Our approach draws on the logic of full-time equivalent jobs, adult equivalent incomes, and other constructs in economics. An initial period is used to calibrate the average depth of poverty among the poor, which then becomes the ``person equivalent'' underlying the p. e. headcount and the p. e. headcount ratio. We illustrate our methods using \$1.25 a day poverty data from 78 countries as provided by the World Bank, and show how the new measures map out different pictures of poverty and progress than traditional headcount measures. Overall, the picture is one of a more rapid decline in global poverty, but with significant redistributions of its burden across regions and countries. For example, p. e. headcounts are much higher than traditional headcounts in Latin America and the Caribbean and Sub Saharan Africa; in South Asia and East Asia and the Pacific the reverse is true. In Kenya the traditional headcount rose by 8 million and the p. e. headcount rose by 11 million; in South Africa the p. e. headcount fell by more than the traditional headcount. We discuss properties of the new measures, outline some generalizations and conclude with recommendations for using this approach in development goals to track progress and direct policy.},

Yet public concern about migration also remains powerful. Origin countries fear loss of skills and increased dependency on remittances from destination countries. Many people in destination countries see migration as a threat to prosperity, identity and security. The securitization of migration in the Global North since 2001 ignores the fact that South\textendash North migration is the result of growing global inequality and lack of human security in the South. It is important to understand that migration is a crucial aspect of human development that can improve the capabilities of individuals and the innovation capacity of societies. This essay provides an overview of some of the key issues in international migration, including a discussion of the effects of the global economic crisis. In conclusion, the essay discusses the `global governance deficit' in migration and looks at some long-term prospects.},

The method imposes no parametric structure on household decision processes, accounts for unobserved preference heterogeneity across individuals in different households, and requires only a single consumption observation per household.Our main identifying assumption is that the observed marital matchings are stable. We apply our method to data drawn from the US Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), for which we assume that similar households (in terms of observed characteristics like age or region of residence) operate on the same marriage market and are characterized by a homogeneous consumption technology. This application shows that our method yields informative results on the nature of scale economies and intrahousehold allocation patterns. In addition, it allows us to define individual compensation schemes required to preserve the same consumption level in case of marriage dissolution or spousal death.},

In this article, we develop modeling and inference tools for counterfactual distributions based on regression methods. The counterfactual scenarios that we consider consist of ceteris paribus changes in either the distribution of covariates related to the outcome of interest or the conditional distribution of the outcome given covariates. For either of these scenarios, we derive joint functional central limit theorems and bootstrap validity results for regression-based estimators of the status quo and counterfactual outcome distributions. These results allow us to construct simultaneous confidence sets for function-valued effects of the counterfactual changes, including the effects on the entire distribution and quantile functions of the outcome as well as on related functionals. These confidence sets can be used to test functional hypotheses such as no-effect, positive effect, or stochastic dominance. Our theory applies to general counterfactual changes and covers the main regression methods including classical, quantile, duration, and distribution regressions. We illustrate the results with an empirical application to wage decompositions using data for the United States. As a part of developing the main results, we introduce distribution regression as a comprehensive and flexible tool for modeling and estimating the entire conditional distribution. We show that distribution regression encompasses the Cox duration regression and represents a useful alternative to quantile regression. We establish functional central limit theorems and bootstrap validity results for the empirical distribution regression process and various related functionals.},

Earnings are shown to increase with schooling, pre-immigration experience and duration in Canada, as well as with proficiency in the official languages (English and French). Using selectivity correction techniques, it is shown that there is complementarity between language skills and both schooling and pre-immigration experience. That is, greater proficiency in the official languages enhances the effects on earnings of schooling and pre-immigration labor market experience. Language proficiency and post-migration experience appear to be substitutes, that is, those with greater proficiency have a smaller effect of time in Canada on earnings.},

The dependent variable is intermarriage across ethnic groups (on the basis of ancestry and country of birth) and the inclusion of the explanatory variables is justified by a simple rational choice economic model. A binomial logistic regression is estimated using data from the 1980 US Census, the last Census where post-migration marriages can be identified. Results show that the probability of intermarriage increases the longer a migrant resides in the U.S. and the younger the age at arrival. Both relationships can be attributable to the accumulation of US-specific human capital and an erosion of ethnic-specific human capital. Inter-ethnic marriages are more likely between individuals with similar education levels, providing evidence of positive assortative mating by education for immigrants. The construction of the ``availability ratio'' for potential spouses from one's own group and group size where one lives using data from several Censuses provides a the measure of the marriage market. Intermarriage is lower the greater the availability ratio and the larger the size of one's own group. Linguistic distance of the immigrant's mother tongue from English indirectly measures the effect of English language proficiency at arrival and is found to be a significant negative predictor of intermarriage. Those who report multiple ancestries and who were previously married are more likely to intermarry.},

Family circumstances such as the presence of young children, partners' hours of work, and family income are important determinants of labor supply. Similarly, human capital, particularly English language ability, is closely related to hours worked, and there is some evidence that spouses' employment is related to the visa category of their partners.

Results reveal that human capital, migration background, religiosity, cultural values, and perceptions of discrimination jointly account for about 40\% of the employment variance between Muslims and non-Muslims. Model specifications for first- and second-generation Muslim immigrants reveal a similar pattern, with migration background and perceived discrimination being of key relevance in mediating employment difference. While individual-level effects are indeed relevant, unexplained variance suggests that symbolic boundaries against Islam may still translate into tangible ethno-religious penalties.},

We draw upon each theoretical model to derive predictions about how different variables are likely to influence the probability of return migration.

Finding some support for both perspectives, we suggest that migrants may be heterogeneous with respect to their migratory motivations. If so, then parameters associated with the determinants of return migration in any population of international migration will reflect a blending of parameters associated with two distinct economic rationales. Equations estimated separately for remitting and non\textendash remitting migrants lend support to this interpretation, meaning there may not be one unitary process of return migration, but several.},

To assess the separate effects of occupational segmentation and discrimination in the allocation of occupations and wages, we conceptualize the process of earnings attainment as occurring in three stages: initial occupational achievement, final occupational achievement after the accumulation of experience, and, contingent on the former, final earnings attainment. Our analysis of data from the German Socioeconomic Panel suggests a high degree of initial occupational segmentation, with mmigrants being less able to translate their human capital into a good first job than natives. We also find that immigrants experienced significant discrimination in the process of occupational attainment, yielding little job mobility over time, and a widening of the status gap between Germans and guestworkers. Holding occupational status constant, however, we find less evidence of direct discrimination in the process of earnings attainment. Although immigrants achieved lower rates of return to technical or vocational training than natives, their wage returns to experience, hours worked, years since migration, and academic high school were greater, yielding significant earnings mobility over time.},

Their making is surprisingly alike. Employing data from the German Socioeconomic Panel 2000 (GSOEP) release we find that self-employment is not significantly affected by exposure to Germany or by human capital. But this choice has a very strong intergenerational link and it is also related to homeownership and financial worries. While individuals are strongly pulled into self-employment if it offers higher earnings, immigrants are additionally pushed into self-employment when they feel discriminated. Married immigrants are more likely to go into self-employment, but less likely when they have young children. Immigrants with foreign passports living in ethnic households are more likely self-employed than native Germans. The earnings of self-employed men increase with exposure to Germany, hours worked and occupational prestige; they decrease with high regional unemployment to vacancies ratios. Everything else equal, the earnings of self-employed Germans are not much different from the earnings of the self-employed immigrants, including those who have become German citizens. However, immigrants suffer a strong earnings penalty if they feel discriminated against while they receive a premium if they are German educated.},

Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} Using Lee's technique, the paper first estimates the probabilities of being in self-employment, a salaried businesswoman, working in other non-entrepreneurial jobs, and not working at all with a multinomial logit, and accordingly adjust the wage regressions for selection and heteroscedasticity. By employing data from the German Socio-economic Panel one can differentiate among different types of self-employment and business entrepreneurship, control for human capital and labor market structures, and estimate wages for native and immigrant women aged 20 to 65. The subject scope includes literature on entrepreneurship, self-employment, gender-edge, and immigrant earnings assimilation. Findings \textendash{} Self-employment offers businesswomen a lucrative avenue with higher monetary rewards, albeit for a shorter spell. If salaried businesswomen went into self-employment, they would receive considerably higher wages and for at least 30 years. However, if self-employed businesswomen went into salaried jobs, their wages would decline. This suggests that it is the self-employment sector that offers better opportunities and monetary success, but not many businesswomen go into it. In these two entrepreneurial outlets human capital, years-since-migration and ethnicity are not significant. Research limitations/implications \textendash{} Future research should overcome the cross-sectional limitation and take advantage of the panel aspect. Practical implications \textendash{} Many qualified, highly educated and talented women are not part of the labor market and the entrepreneurial world. Germany should encourage these women to work, as it needs skilled workers and a stronger entrepreneurial sector. Financial disparities still exist between West and East Germany. Originality/value \textendash{} The novelty comes from asserting that the entrepreneurial spirit can also exist in salaried jobs. The added value is the new empirical evidence on the importance of self-employment in Germany, where women fare well and success does not depend on ethnicity.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies demonstrate that married women sacrifice their own careers in order to support their husbands' careers by following them as tied migrants, largely independent of their own occupational status. Thus, it appears as if family migration is shaped by the dominant gender roles and gender identities which configure the lives of women and men in married couple families. The motivation for this paper stems from a concern that family migration research has failed to consider that the effects of family migration on the labor-market participation of married women may be contingent on parental status. This research is designed to uncover the individual and joint effects of migration and parental status on married women's labor-market participation. The approach taken in this research is to begin with a very specific type of married couple family\textemdash married couple families without children\textemdash and to trace how the birth of the first child and migration events independently and jointly determine women's labor-market participation over a 5-year time span. The data for the analysis are drawn from the 1987 through 1992 Family File of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Random effects probit models of labor-force participation and employment indicate a small, short-lived, impact of migration on the employment of married women without children\textemdash but for married women with children the negative effects of family migration on both labor force participation and employment are large and endure for many years.},

It sets out to answer these questions by looking in depth at the experience of 30 countries over the past 30 years, examining what has actually been happening to these inequalities and investigating how this can be related to social and political outcomes such as poverty, family structures, health and health inequalities, crime, political participation, and attitudes and values. This brings out that although many countries have seen some increase in income inequality, country experiences have varied widely, that an immediate impact on average levels of social problems is difficult to see though there may be some interaction with political behaviours and changes to social gradients. What does stand out is that policies matter both in terms of ameliorating background inequality pressures and mitigating the extent to which inequalities in income spill over to other domains.},

There is considerable debate about the most appropriate degree of multidimensionality to retain in the analysis. In this work we add to the received literature in two ways. First, we derive indicators of multiple deprivation by applying a particular multivariate statistical technique, the non-linear principal component analysis (NLPCA), which overcomes traditional limits of many of the mostly used methodologies for poverty measurement. Second, on the basis of the aforementioned indicators, we provide an accurate identification of the poor in Italy by analyzing deprivation both as a distinct phenomenon in different life domains and as a single multidimensional concept. The main determinants of poverty in Italy are then investigated by estimating logit regressions and an ordered probit model. Our empirical analysis is based on data from the Italian component of European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC-2004).},

Drawing on interviews with 215 people who crossed the Mediterranean to Greece in 2015, our paper challenges this `categorical fetishism', arguing that the dominant categories fail to capture adequately the complex relationship between political, social and economic drivers of migration or their shifting significance for individuals over time and space. As such it builds upon a substantial body of academic literature demonstrating a disjuncture between conceptual and policy categories and the lived experiences of those on the move. However, the paper is also critical of efforts to foreground or privilege `refugees' over `migrants' arguing that this reinforces rather than challenges the dichotomy's faulty foundations. Rather those concerned about the use of categories to marginalise and exclude should explicitly engage with the politics of bounding, that is to say, the process by which categories are constructed, the purpose they serve and their consequences, in order to denaturalise their use as a mechanism to distinguish, divide and discriminate.},

The paper shows that people care about social comparison information in a number of domains, not just income. Using an equivalent income approach, the estimates suggest that a one standard deviation deterioration of the individual position in the income distribution is as important as a 33.5 percent decrease in own income. This monetary equivalent amounts to an income variation of between 25 and 43 percent when it comes to other deprivation domains, including durables, accommodation, health, and social relations. These results recommend that in the fight against deprivation more emphasis should be directed to these non-monetary relevant dimensions.},

In this study, we ask whether it is appropriate to use a common equivalence scale when comparing economic well-being across countries and/or time if consumption expenditure patterns differ? Based on an Engel methodology, we estimate equivalence scales for a diverse set of countries (Canada, France, Israel, Poland, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, United States) in different time periods (1999\textendash 2012). We find considerable differences in economies of scale across countries, as well as increases over time. Notably, we find that economies of scale are larger than those implied by the widely accepted `square root of household size' equivalence scale. Our results indicate that using a common equivalence scale to compare economic well-being across countries and/or time is misleading. Specifically, if economies of scale are understated (as is the case when using the `square root of household size'), the relative poverty experienced by larger versus smaller families is being overstated.},

These asymmetric results are partly driven by a higher degree of substitution between old and new immigrants in the labor market and in part by the rigidity of wages in less than flexible labor markets. In a simple counter-factual experiment we show that in a world of perfect wage flexibility and no unemployment insurance the wage-bill loss of old immigrants would be much smaller.},

  abstract = {Since 1990, the World Bank, most of the other international agencies and an increasing number of governments have committed themselves to the eradication of poverty. But the basis of their work badly needs overhaul and concerted verification. Breadline Europe provides a scientific and international basis for the analysis and reduction of poverty. It demonstrates that there is far more important research into the problem of poverty going on in many countries of Europe than the international agencies and national governments admit or even realise. Knowledge of the major scientific advances in research needs to be spread among other countries within as well as outside Europe. Breadline Europe has been written by a number of leading European poverty researchers and has three main themes: the need for a scientific poverty line: for better definition and measurement of what is the biggest and rapidly growing international social problem; the need for better theories distinguishing between poverty and social exclusion, with the corresponding policies calculated to diminish these problems;the need for better international social policy and for better policy-related analyses of poverty: for more exact analysis of the year-by-year contribution of specific policies to poverty. This is the first book to examine poverty in Europe within the international framework agreed at the 1995 World Summit on Social Development. Breadline Europe provides up-to-date, essential reading for social science undergraduates and postgraduate students. It will also be of considerable interest to policy makers and NGOs with a concern for poverty reduction.},

  abstract = {This paper elaborates an aspirations\textendash capabilities framework to advance our understanding of human mobility. Arguing in favour of conceptual eclecticism to bridge disciplinary and paradigmatic divides, the paper conceives migration as an intrinsic part of broader processes of social transformation and development. In this perspective, theoretical assumptions are seen as contextualised statements rather than mutually exclusive truth claims. On the macro-level, such conceptualisation of migration requires embedding the analysis of migration into broader theories of social change without reverting back to the top-down causal determinism of many historical-structural and functionalist theories. To develop a more meaningful understanding of agency in migration processes, and building upon Carling's (2002) earlier work, the paper proposes a meta-theoretical conceptualisation of migration as a function of aspirations and capabilities to migrate within a given set of opportunity structures. Drawing on Sen's capabilities approach, this paper defines human mobility as people's capability (freedom) to choose where to live, including the option to stay. While distinguishing between the instrumental (means to an end) and intrinsic (directly wellbeing-enhancing) dimensions of human mobility, this conceptualises moving and staying as complementary manifestations of the same migratory agency. This allows to move beyond the rather futile debate over whether migration or sedentary behaviour is the norm and to overcome dichotomous and simplistic classifications such as between forced and voluntary migration. The paper draws on Berlin's concepts of positive and negative liberty to conceptualise the complex and non-linear ways in which structural conditions shape migration aspirations and capabilities. The resulting expanded aspirations-capabilities framework is used to elaborate a theoretical categorisation of five ideal, typical mobility types. The concepts of positive and negative liberty (as manifestations of different structural conditions under which migration occurs) are used to elaborate a categorisation of four contextual migration categories, to which different migration theories have different degrees of explanatory power.},

It investigates the complex links between migration policies and migration trends to disentangle policy effects from structural migration determinants. The analysis challenges two central assumptions underpinning the popular idea that migration restrictions have failed to curb migration. First, post-WWII global migration levels have not accelerated, but remained relatively stable while most shifts in migration patterns have been directional. Second, post-WWII migration policies have generally liberalized despite political rhetoric suggesting the contrary. While migration policies are generally effective, ``substitution effects'' can limit their effectiveness, or even make them counterproductive, by geographically diverting migration, interrupting circulation, encouraging unauthorized migration, or prompting ``now or never'' migration surges. These effects expose fundamental policy dilemmas and highlight the importance of understanding the economic, social, and political trends that shape migration in sometimes counterintuitive, but powerful, ways that largely lie beyond the reach of migration policies.},

International migration is one of the most emotive issues of our times, reforging societies around the world and shaping debates on security, national identity and sovereignty in profound ways. The expert authors of this book provide a truly global and interdisciplinary introduction to this perennially important topic, with chapters covering all of the world's regions and spanning the nineteenth century to the present day. Exploring the significance of migration in relation to recent events and emerging trends, from the policies of the European Union to the Great Recession, this text helps to shed light on the often large gap between the rhetoric and realities of migration. For students of migration studies in disciplines as wide ranging as Politics, Sociology, Geography, Area Studies, Anthropology and History this is an indispensable guide, whether already familiar with the subject matter or approaching the topic for the first time.

They take changes in SWHI, which may differ within couples, to indicate changes in perceived benefits from their common household income, benefits that can go beyond individual consumption. Using data from the British Household Panel Survey for 2,396 couples from 1996 to 2007, three gender effects are identified. First, men predominate in making the type of contribution that most positively influences SWHI, namely, full-time employment. Second, the effect of contributions depends on the gender of the contributor, with men's employment being more influential than women's. Third, within couples, making the more influential contribution, as men tend to do, leads to relatively greater SWHI. The authors conclude that gender asymmetry in contributions made to household resources is one way in which gender inequalities invade and inhabit households.},

State immigrant polices may influence immigrant poverty by determining immigrants' level of access to social, economic, political, and health resources and by shaping the social environment. Further, these immigrant policies may shape the stratification between citizens and noncitizens, potentially contributing to distinct patterns of disparities in poverty by both citizenship and race/ethnicity. To assess the relationship between immigrant policy and socioeconomic stratification of immigrants across citizenship status and race/ethnicity in the U.S., we combined data from the 2014 American Community Survey and a measure of level of inclusion of state immigrant policies. We estimated fixed-effects logistic regressions to test the associations between poverty and the interaction of level of inclusiveness, citizenship, and race/ethnicity, controlling for state- and individual-level characteristics. Results showed that there are significant disparities in poverty by citizenship status and race/ethnicity. Asian/Pacific Islander (API) noncitizens experienced lower levels of poverty in states with higher levels of inclusion. Both Latino and API citizens experienced lower levels of poverty in states with higher versus lower levels of inclusion. Among Latinos, the gap in poverty rates between noncitizens and citizens is larger in more inclusive than less inclusive ones, suggesting that the potential positive impact of more inclusive environments does not necessarily translate to the most vulnerable Latino group. The level of inclusion was not associated with differences among Whites and Blacks. Findings suggest that states with more inclusive immigrant policies may foster environments that advance the economic well-being of API noncitizens, as well as API and Latino citizens.},

Such a direct measurement of poverty in fact followed Peter Townsend's (1979) original ideas in so far as poverty was defined as a lack of `socially perceived necessities' (Mack and Lansley, 1985). For Mack and Lansley, an item should be classified as a necessity if more than 50 per cent of the population considered it as such. Haller\"od (1994) criticized such an approach and defined it as a `majority' rather than as a `consensual' approach. He suggested using a `proportional deprivation index' where all the original items taken into account in the survey are included in a weighting scheme where the weight of an item is derived from the proportion of individuals regarding this item as a necessity.},

We argue instead that naturalization offers an opportunity for individual upward mobility to Turkish migrants who have achieved a high level of individual assimilation. Using data from the GSOEP, we show that individual assimilation does in fact promote naturalization for Turkish migrants, but not for members of other ethnic groups, which generally have higher status within German society.},

Results suggest that, for both groups, individuals with strong religious commitments are less likely than secular individuals to hold egalitarian gender role attitudes. At the behavioural level, this correlation between religiosity and gender egalitarianism only holds true for Turkish respondents. Furthermore, strong religious commitments contribute to generational stability in attitudinal and behavioural gender-traditionalism among Turks. However, when explaining Germans' more egalitarian gender-related attitudes and behaviours, religiosity turns out to be just one factor among others \textendash{} and not a particularly important one. Further research is needed to disentangle the different cultural and religious aspects of Muslim migrants' attitudes and behaviours.},

To do so, event-history analysis is applied to data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP). Findings reveal an increase in remigration intentions as well as rates of return for first generation migrants after the turn of the millennium. Before that, both such intentions and rates of actual return had declined, mostly as a consequence of integration in Germany. Those migrants who plan to return have a stronger emotional attachment to Turkey than those who plan to stay. However, the two groups differ neither with respect to their educational levels nor in terms of their perceptions of discrimination. There are similar findings with respect to the small though slightly increasing group of immigrants who actually returned to Turkey. It is thus argued that rising remigration intentions and actual remigration among first-generation migrants are unrelated to their integration into German society and are probably triggered by social change in their country of origin.},

The discussion explores the factors triggering intergenerational progress and change, exploring the extent to which a lack of educational attainment results in later disadvantage in the labour market. The most prevalent approaches to explaining group-specific trajectories are presented, with the focus on the ongoing disadvantage for those of Turkish descent. Factors other than educational attainment are also explored, namely by addressing the most important results from existing studies on the role of language skills, social ties and ethnic discrimination.},

Although personality can explain a significant amount of the variability in SWB, life circumstances also influence long-term levels. Cultural variables explain differences in mean levels of SWB and appear to be due to objective factors such as wealth, to norms dictating appropriate feelings and how important SWB is considered to be, and to the relative approach versus avoidance tendencies of societies. Culture can also moderate which variables most influence SWB. Although it is challenging to assess SWB across societies, the measures have some degree of cross-cultural validity. Although nations can be evaluated by their levels of SWB, there are still many open questions in this area.},

This approach undervalues two key features of any stratification system: family dynamics and the welfare state. Employment changes, changes in household composition, and changes in the employment situation of a spouse or partner can all trigger large shifts in income and material well-being. The impact of these events is mediated by public tax and transfer mechanisms and by private actions taken by household members. This comparative analysis of household income dynamics in the United States and Germany shows that variations in welfare state policy produce distinct societal patterns of income mobility, and furthermore, shows that the relative importance of labor market events, family change, and welfare state policies for income dynamics depends on gender. The strong interrelationship between individual incentives and the structure of opportunity produces an asymmetry in the long-term impact of events. The negative effects of events that reduce income generally decay over time, while the effects of positive events generally persist.},

The results show that the female African immigrant population increased by an annual average growth rate of 23\% between 1980 and 2008, with a much higher growth among black female Africans (81\%) than whites (5\%). The racial composition shifted from a white majority (68\%) in 1980 to a black majority (72\%) in 2008. Multivariate analysis of the labor force participation and personal earnings showed that the white advantage echoed in previous research had disappeared in 2008 when black African women became more likely to be in the labor force participation and to earn higher income than their white counterparts, net of the effects of socio-demographic variables. Such results challenge the labor queue theory, which assumes that white people have an absolute advantage in American job market.},

Prior studies have established that immigrant women are doubly disadvantaged in terms of labor market outcomes in the U.S., Canada, and Israel. These studies suggest an intriguing question: Are there gender gaps in immigrant labor force participation across destinations countries? In this paper, we investigate the extent to which the double disadvantage exists for immigrant women in a variety of host countries. We also examine how marriage moderates this double disadvantage. For the U.S., although we find that immigrant women have had the lowest labor force participation rates compared to natives and immigrant men since 1960, marital status is an important stratifying attribute that helps explain nativity differences. Extending the analysis to eight other countries reveals strong gender differences in labor force participation and shows how marriage differentiates immigrant women's labor force entry more so than men's.},

It reconstructs the different challenges that migration flows have posed to European countries over the years and the policymaking responses developed accordingly. The chapter distinguishes three European migratory regimes: (i) North-Western Europe; (ii) Southern Europe; (iii) and Central and Eastern Europe. The diversity of migration policies adopted in each of these migratory systems is explained in relation to their geographical location, economic context, political history, and also notions of nationhood, national belonging and organization of government. Also integration policies are discussed, with the overall aim to clarify how the concept of integration has been used in policy formulation and policy practice in Europe. Furthermore, the chapter analyses the developments towards creation of a comprehensive European migration and asylum regime. Policymaking at the EU level has supplemented and sometimes challenged national policymaking in two main ways. First, the EU may subsidize local integration initiatives that would otherwise remain unfunded (e.g., by national governments). Second, EU mandates may limit objectives established at the national level that are at odds with EU law (e.g., restricting nations' power to restrict the rights of third-country nationals). The main conclusion is that a convergence of migration and integration regimes in Europe is in clear evidence.},

  abstract = {The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) has been an important contribution to the debate on national and international poverty measurement. With the creation of the global MPI, OHPI and UNDP have provided a household-level multidimensional poverty measure for over 100 developing countries that can usefully complement the widely used \$1.25 a day income poverty indicator. Given its link to the concept of human development, it is an important element of the suite of human development indicators maintained and published by UNDP. Nonetheless, there are many open empirical questions and issues regarding the conceptual underpinning of the MPI that need to be discussed and carefully considered. This essay discusses issues with the dual cut-off method for poverty identification, and how inequality could be incorporated in this poverty measure. Moreover, the choice of headline indicator is debated. We also propose a number of changes regarding the empirical implementation. These include dropping the WHS as one of the data sources, dropping the BMI as a nutrition indicator, and changing the age ranges and cutoffs for the education and mortality indicators. Different approaches to deal with the large share of households where information on an MPI indicator is missing are also discussed. The empirical relevance of these changes are analysed using the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for Armenia, Ethiopia, and India. We argue that these changes could pose improvements to the current formulation, but one may need to investigate them further and for a larger number of countries. In a final section, we briefly comment on the HDRO revisions to the MPI in the 2014 Human Development Report, which have been partly based on the recommendations made in this paper.},

Therefore, it is important to establish the characteristics and labour market performance of migrants from these countries who have subsequently entered the United Kingdom. We principally analyse Labour Force Survey data to compare the labour market outcomes of recent migrants from Poland and other accession countries to those of earlier migrant cohorts from these countries as well as to those of other recent migrants to the United Kingdom. We find that the majority of post-enlargement migrants from the new member states have found employment in low paying jobs, despite some (especially Poles) possessing relatively high levels of education. It follows that recent Polish migrants typically have lower returns to their education than other recent arrivals. Migrants from the new member states who arrived immediately prior to enlargement have similar characteristics and labour market outcomes, apart from displaying a higher propensity to be self-employed. These results are discussed in the context of policy changes, migration strategies, assimilation effects and possible impacts on the sending countries.},

We also provide a new method of identifying the level of fixed or random resource shares that does not require previously needed preference similarity restrictions or marriage market assumptions.

There is little evidence for differential wage responses to economic shocks.

Our analysis demonstrates that the EU's conception of refugee-migrants is more closely affiliated with the notion of `Global citizens' rather than with that of `European citizens'. Furthermore, we suggest that the EU distinguishes and navigates between various migratory flows, namely internal-European, desired external-European and undesired external-European (refugee-migrants), each associated with a distinctive conception of citizenship as well as with related policy discourses. In the light of the migratory flows into Europe, the particularistic conceptions of citizenship shaping the EU's educational policy carry considerable implications for the future integration of refugee-migrants in Europe.},

This pattern for the total population is the net result of disparate trends in the satisfaction people get from various life domains: their financial situation, family life, health, and work. The slight rise in happiness through midlife is due chiefly to growing satisfaction with one's family life and work, which together more than offset decreasing satisfaction with health. Beyond midlife, happiness edges downward as a continuing decline in satisfaction with health is joined by diminishing satisfaction with one's family situation and work; these negative trends are offset considerably, however, by a sizeable upturn in later life in people's satisfaction with their financial situation. These findings come from an analysis of the United States General Social Surveys, using the demographer's synthetic panel technique. They support neither the mainstream economics view that well-being depends only on one's objective conditions nor the psychologists' strong setpoint model in which adaptation to such conditions is rapid and complete. They are consistent with a ``bottom up'' model in which happiness is the net outcome of both objective and subjective factors in various life domains.},

Within the groups of men and women, we show that all non-French applicants are equally discriminated against when compared to French applicants. Moreover, we find direct evidence of ethnic homophily: recruiters with European names are more likely to call back French named applicants. These results show the importance of favoritism for in-group members. To test for the effect of information about applicant's skills, we also add a signal related to language ability in all resumes sent to half the job offers. The design allows to uniquely identify the effect of the language signal by gender.

Yet it has received sparse attention within the literature on domestic monies. This literature has noted that money management practices operate either to diminish or to exacerbate inequalities between women and men, most noticeably in the realm of decision-making and personal spending money. Independent money management is pursued in order to achieve equality and autonomy, thereby overcoming some of the difficulties identified in other forms of money management. However, it is argued that equality and autonomy exist in tension with each other. In certain relational settings, adherence to the goal of autonomy leads to the emergence of inequalities and the continued exercise of power within heterosexual relationships.},

This Special Issue offers an empirical and normative contribution to this critical turn in migration studies by examining the multiple ways in which immigration and citizenship policy continues to create hierarchies among migrants that mirror the intersection of non-meritocratic attributes of social group membership. We show that access to territory and citizenship is governed by highly differentiated legal distinctions that closely map onto social identities such as gender, race/ethnicity, nationality, religion, and class. This introduction maps two important and interrelated developments in the literature which this issue engages. First, the `politics of belonging' remains shaped by the intersection of multiple axes of inclusion and exclusion that are (re)produced by immigration and citizenship policy. Second, whereas legal precarity has long been associated with undocumented and temporary immigration status, over the past two decades precarity has penetrated all immigration status, including those that have long been understood as secure. The article concludes with an overview of the Special Issue's individual contributions and identifies some remaining research needs.},

Examining economic and family immigrant admissions, the article tests two sets of propositions.

As a second proposition, the article contends that economic considerations are being increasingly applied to immigrants who arrive through non-economic streams. As the desirability of immigrants has come to correspond to their rank in the labour market hierarchy, the accompanying process of market invasion has led to an increasing blurring of longstanding normative and policy distinctions between economic and non-economic immigration.},

  abstract = {Immigrants concentrate in particular lines of work. Most investigations of such employment niching have accented either the demand for labor in a limited set of mostly low-wage industries or the efficiency of immigrant networks in supplying that labor; space has taken a backseat or has been ignored. In contrast, this article's account of immigrant employment niching modulates insights built on social network theories with understandings derived from relative location. We do so by altering the thinking about employment niches as being metropolitan wide to considering them as local phenomena. Specifically, the analysis examines the intraurban variation in niching by Mexican, Salvadoran, Chinese, and Vietnamese men and women in four industries in Los Angeles. Niching is uneven; in some parts of the metropolitan area, these groups niche at high rates in these industries, whereas in others, there is no unusual concentration. We show how a group's propensity to niche in an industry is generally higher when the industry is located close to the group's residential neighborhoods and demonstrate the ways in which the proximity of competing groups dampens this geographic advantage. The study speaks to debates on immigrant niching and connects with research on minority access to employment and accounts of the agglomeration of firms. More generally, it links the geographies of home and work in a new way, relating patterns of immigrant residential segregation to those of immigrant employment niches.},

Because the devaluation of activities done by women has changed little, women have had strong incentive to enter male jobs, but men have had little incentive to take on female activities or jobs. The gender egalitarianism that gained traction was the notion that women should have access to upward mobility and to all areas of schooling and jobs. But persistent gender essentialism means that most people follow gender-typical paths except when upward mobility is impossible otherwise. Middle-class women entered managerial and professional jobs more than working-class women integrated blue-collar jobs because the latter were able to move up while choosing a ``female'' occupation; many mothers of middle-class women were already in the highest-status female occupations. The author also notes a number of gender-egalitarian trends that have stalled.},

Socio-cultural integration is measured by host-country identification, proficiency and use of the host-country language, and interethnic social contacts. To increase cross-national comparability, we focus on immigrants from two rural regions in Turkey who migrated before 1975. Based on the assumption that easily accessible citizenship promotes socio-cultural integration, we test two hypotheses. First, whether naturalised immigrants display higher levels of socio-cultural integration than non-naturalised immigrants. Second, whether immigrants in countries with few preconditions for naturalisation show higher levels of socio-cultural integration. We find that naturalisation is positively associated with socio-cultural integration only in those countries\textemdash France and Germany\textemdash that have traditionally required a certain degree of cultural assimilation from their new citizens. Regarding country differences, we find that Turkish immigrants in France show higher levels of socio-cultural integration on all four indicators. For host-country identification, they share this position with Dutch Turks. The results show that limited cultural assimilation conditions tied to citizenship may be helpful in promoting socio-cultural integration, but also that the allowance of dual nationality does not have the negative effects that are sometimes ascribed to it.},

Special attention will be given to the resilience of immigrants visible in their responses to the labour market constraints, namely through their choices of geographic (im)mobility and also the implementation of strategies to `normalise' their lives. Starting with a brief reference to the meaning of integration in Portugal in a context of crisis, we draw on data from two research projects, arguing that despite the increased hardship, the resilience of foreign workers is considerable and they still think it is worth coming to Portugal. The strategies adopted may be either in situ or implying onward migration, resulting from the combination of context opportunities and individual agency. Factors like legal status, education and having relatives abroad play a moderate role in this process.},

One of the three indicators used to monitor progress towards this target is the EU indicator of "severe material deprivation (MD)". The main limitations of the current EU MD indicators are the small number (nine) and weak reliability of some of the core items they are based on. MD measures for children are also needed. This is why a thematic module on MD was included in the 2009 wave of EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions survey (EU-SILC). The core MD items of EU-SILC and related indicators will be revised as part of the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 Strategy in 2015. This paper is an assessment of the 2009 EU-SILC MD data by researchers participating in the Second Network for the analysis of EU-SILC (Net-SILC2). It proposes an analytical framework for developing robust EU MD indicators for the whole population as well as for children.},

Third, in many countries with low levels of education for both men and women in 1960, gender gaps widened as more boys went to school, then narrowed as girls enrolled; thus, gender gaps got worse before they got better. Fourth, gender gaps rarely persist in countries where boys are attaining high levels of education. Most countries with large, current gender gaps have low levels of male educational attainment. Many also perform poorly on other measures of development such as life expectancy and GDP per capita. Improving girls' education is an important goal in its own right, but closing gender gaps in education will not be sufficient to close critical gaps in adult life outcomes.},

Existing research suggests that positive immigrant selectivity helps explain paradoxical patterns of success among immigrants and their children in health, the labor market, and education. However, future research is needed that uses more rigorous research designs and measures, links immigrant selectivity and outcomes across domains, identifies the mechanisms through which immigrant selectivity matters, and considers different types of immigrant selectivity.

In this paper, we investigate whether, and to what extent, immigrants' different areas of origin moderate the returns to educational degrees obtained in the origin country. Data from a survey on the immigrant population (carried out in 2011\textendash 2012) are used, and, differently from previous studies, we focus on returns to origin-country education with respect to both the socioeconomic status of the first job found on arrival and the subsequent occupational mobility. The results show that almost all nonWestern immigrants experience remarkably low returns to post-secondary education on their first job. Contrary to other West-European countries, those returns in Italy are only slightly different by area of origin, which suggests that differences in the transferability and quality of skills are scarcely relevant in a strongly segmented labour market. Rather, the modes of labour market insertion\rule{1em}{1pt}e.g., formal search methods or relying on contacts with natives\rule{1em}{1pt}have a sizeable impact on the returns. Origin-country post-secondary degrees are also consistently associated with low returns on subsequent mobility, although highly educated immigrants from new EU member states experience higher chances of upward mobility. In line with some recent findings, recognition of educational credentials seems decisive for the very few non-Western immigrants who are able either to access better-qualified jobs on arrival or to improve their occupational status over time.},

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to analyse occupational mobility among immigrants in Spain in two distinct stages: (1) comparing the immigrants' first job in Spain with their profession in the country of origin and (2) comparing their current occupational status with the occupational status of the first job they held in Spain. We focus on immigrants who arrived in Spain during the "immigration boom" that took place between 1997 and 2007, using data from the 2007 National Survey on Immigration. For our analysis, we use occupational mobility tables and multi-variable models with occupational mobility as a dependent variable. Our results show that we can better understand the initial access of migrants to the Spanish labour market from the perspective of labour market segregation: for each gender, a particular sector/occupational level (construction and cleaning, respectively) played such a dominant role that it determined almost entirely the observed mobility pattern. We find some (upward) mobility opportunities after such initial strong segregation, which increased with length of residence; however, our results suggest that, even in this case, it is mostly limited to men and associated with the construction boom that finished abruptly in 2007.},

This approach does not require imposing any functional form on wealth and avoids validity-out-of-the-support assumptions; furthermore, it allows estimation not only of the mean of the wealth gap but also of its distribution for the common-support sub-population. The results show that on average there is a positive and significant wealth gap between natives and migrants. However, the average gap may be misleading as the distribution of the gap reveals that immigrant households in the upper part of the wealth distribution are better off, and those in the lower part of the wealth distribution are worse off, than comparable native households. A heterogeneity analysis shows the importance of origin, age at migration, and citizenship status in reducing the gap. Indeed, households who migrated within Europe, those who moved at younger ages rather than as adults, and those who are citizens of the destination country display a wealth gap that is consistently smaller over the entire distribution.},

We find evidence for heterogeneity in the assimilation profiles for both annual earnings and unemployment probabilities. Robust assimilation profiles are found for two cohorts only.

We compare two relative measures of in-work poverty: The individual definition refers to workers whose salary is below 60\% of the median, while the household-level definition refers to individuals whose household income is below 60\% of the median. Microdata from the 2014 EU-SILC survey and macrodata on involuntary part-time employment and female labor market participation are used to perform a multilevel analysis on 31 European countries. The results show a positive relationship between involuntary part-time work and in-work poverty according to the household definition. Female labor market participation is positively associated with the individual definition and negatively with the household one. However, after controlling for the level of within-country income inequality, only the effect of the female employment rate remains positive and significant for the individual in-work. These results shed light on the multifaceted role of labor market characteristics related to female employment and their implications for policy. We argue that the promotion of female participation should be combined with explicit measures to reduce the disadvantageous position of women in the labor market.},

In order to offer some general views on this Issue's contributions and to highlight some of the explanatory potential of this collective work, we frame the collected articles by referring to different dimensions of integration: (i) residence status and political rights; (ii) socio-economic conditions; and (iii) perceptions of migrants and the receiving society. Contributions show that in Southern Europe the legal-political and cultural dimensions of integration, i.e. legal status and perceptions towards migrants, have apparently been more resilient to the crisis than the economic dimension, such as the socio-economic conditions of migrants.},

Our heterogeneous choice and OLS regressions of 2009 German Microcensus data reveal considerable variation in gender gaps in labour market behaviour between East and West Germany, across ethnic groups and across generations.

The BWS study was administered to 413 randomly sampled individuals, together with sociodemographic and other questions. Scale-adjusted latent class analyses identified two preference and two (variance) scale classes. Ability to characterize preference and scale heterogeneity was limited, but data quality was good, and the final model exhibited a high pseudo-r-squared. After adjusting for heterogeneity, a population tariff was estimated. This showed that `attachment' and `stability' each account for around 22\% of the space, and `autonomy', `achievement' and `enjoyment' account for around 18\% each. Across all attributes, greater value was placed on the difference between the lowest levels of capability than between the highest. This tariff will enable ICECAP-A to be used in economic evaluation both within the field of health and across public policy generally. \textcopyright{} 2013 The Authors.

Our main sample considers the 1990-2014 period. The patterns of time to first contact and labour market entry vary with business cycle conditions, country of origin and other background characteristics. But the main message is the remarkable stability of a relatively slow entry process and long-term outcomes below those of the average worker. The number of jobs before the ``first real job'' (entry) is limited and the first employer contact is for many a port to a more stable position. First jobs are comparatively often found in small, low-wage firms, which over time have become increasingly present in service industries. Our discussion of policy experiences suggests several margins and factors affecting the labour market outcomes of recent migrants, but also indicates that no single reform or measure is likely to in itself radically change the patterns.},

The analysis is based on the Italian Labour Force Survey and highlights the fact that the great majority of immigrants entering Italy are hardly disadvantaged in comparison to Italians as regards the risk of unemployment, but, in contrast, they are highly disfavoured as regards the socio-professional status of their jobs. Unlike what would happen with the old European immigration, nowadays the segregation of immigrant workers in the lowest ranks of the occupational ladder is not due to their poor education. On the contrary, their disadvantage increases if educational attainment is taken into account. The leading role of low-skilled labour demand and underground economy in shaping immigrants' integration in the Italian labour market is confirmed by the fact that they have fairly easy access to unskilled and semi-skilled manual jobs, whereas they experience serious difficulties in entering self-employment and in obtaining non-manual jobs.},

Regression models show that, controlling for age, educational attainment and region, immigrant workers lose their jobs more often than natives but, once being unemployed they have more probabilities of finding a job than natives. As the probabilities of both transitions can be affected by characteristics of the initial status as well, the two transitions have been analysed separately. For the risk of losing a job, the segregation of immigrants in the secondary labour market seems to be the main reason of their penalization, but also the main reason of their advantage in job seeking, since their unemployment spells are shorter than those of natives, although at the cost of accepting worse working conditions. Analyses are based on the yearly transition matrices of Italian Labour Force Surveys, from 2005 to 2008.},

While similar to traditional studies of wage assimilation, a study of assimilation in relation to poverty propensity nevertheless measures something different than labor market assimilation, and this represents the main innovation of this study. Analysis of assimilation with respect to poverty focuses on welfare for the lower end of the income distribution and for all individuals, regardless of their relationship with the labor market. It can therefore be seen to better reflect the degree to which immigrants as a whole are able to achieve at least the minimum necessary to participate in the life of their new home and avoid difficulties later on.},

We compare the resulting scale to two existing internationally standardized measures of occupational status, Treiman's international prestige scale (SIOPS) and Goldthorpe's class categories (EGP), and also with several locally developed SEI scales. The performance of the new ISEI scale compares favorably with these alternatives, both for the data sets used to construct the scale and for five additional data sets.},

It traces the origin of this change in policy perspective, reviewing the Europeanization of immigration and integration policy since the Tampere Programme (1999\textendash 2004). Indeed, a major shift in policy framing came in 2011, with the renewed European Agenda for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals, which explicitly added the countries of origin as a third key actor in the process of immigrants' integration, thereby introducing the three-way process in European policy. In addition to tracing the development of European policy on integration, it takes a step back to consider three broad and interconnected issues: (i) the way integration is conceptualized and studied in Europe; (ii) the way integration policies are studied and how the concept of integration is used in policy formulation and practice; and (iii) the way new perspectives and actors (e.g., those in countries of origin) are incorporated in analyses of integration processes and policies. It concludes by introducing the further structure of the volume.},

We find that faster access to citizenship improves the economic situation of immigrant women, especially their labour market attachment with higher employment rates, longer working hours and more stable jobs. Immigrants also invest more in host country-specific skills like language and vocational training. Faster access to citizenship seems a powerful policy instrument to boost economic integration in countries with traditionally restrictive citizenship policies.},

  abstract = {This study analyses differences in individual-level working poverty determinants between Germany and the UK. These differences are linked to institutional patterns at the country level. Here, we observe that the two countries differ especially in bargaining centralisation, employment protection legislation and family policy. At the same time, the levels of decommodification and labour market regulation are no longer core differences in the institutional settings of Germany and the UK, which is interpreted as a consequence of Germany's departure from a traditional conservative regime since the mid-1990s. Adopting economic and sociological approaches, we explain how Germany's closed employment system channels the effects of deregulation policies to the periphery of the labour market. Additionally, we argue that open employment relationships that dominate in the UK put specifically older employees at risk. Finally, we identify country-specific differences in the economic dependency of women, resulting from a stronger male breadwinner orientation of family policy in Germany. Accordingly, multivariate analyses based on harmonised versions of the British Household Panel Study (2002\textendash 2005) and the Socio-Economic Panel Study (2003\textendash 2006) reveal that entrants and re-entrants to the labour market, women and \textendash{} unexpectedly \textendash{} low-educated persons are particularly affected by in-work poverty in Germany; whereas older workers are more likely to face precarious economic conditions in the UK.},

Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP), we first show that the general poverty rate in Germany has constantly increased since the late 1990s. Shifting to a life-course perspective, we show that not only socio-structural characteristics have a strong impact on the poverty risk, but also critical life-events. While focusing on dynamics of poverty within individual life-courses, it appears that incidents like formation of a 'new household, birth of a child and separation from partner are associated with an immediate increase of the poverty risk. The event of becoming unemployed stands particularly out. Comparing longitudinal and fixed-effects approaches on the one hand with simple cross-sectional procedures on the other, our analyses finally emphasises that cross-sectional analyses are not sufficient to fully understand or to explain poverty. Therefore, our study can be interpreted as a claim to make stronger use of the benefits of longitudinal data in the context of poverty research.},

These aspects of the grand gender convergence are figurative chapters in a history of gender roles. But what must the "last" chapter contain for there to be equality in the labor market? The answer may come as a surprise. The solution does not (necessarily) have to involve government intervention and it need not make men more responsible in the home (although that wouldn't hurt). But it must involve changes in the labor market, especially how jobs are structured and remunerated to enhance temporal flexibility. The gender gap in pay would be considerably reduced and might vanish altogether if firms did not have an incentive to disproportionately reward individuals who labored long hours and worked particular hours. Such change has taken off in various sectors, such as technology, science, and health, but is less apparent in the corporate, financial, and legal worlds.},

We show supporting evidence that around 89 to 94\% of these pairs are indeed married couples and provide careful consistency checks. Using information from the German Microcensus, we show that our method identifies about 17\% of all married couples in Germany and about 35\% of couples where both spouses are in social security covered jobs or unemployed. In ongoing work this couple identifier will be made available to the research community and users for the IAB administrative data. Our method thus opens the door for household level analyses benefiting from the precision and very large number of observations available in administrative data.},

  abstract = {The labour performance of migrants has been largely assumed to vary with individuals' reasons to migrate. Accordingly, migrants who migrate to join their relatives at destination are commonly expected to be negatively selected in terms of their labour characteristics. However, family and economic reasons for migration are not mutually exclusive but often complementary, especially among women. In addition, there exists a large variation in the post-migration employment rates of the so-called `family migrants'. In this article, I argue that the temporal sequence of migration and key family life-cycle events may help us in explaining the post-migration employment patterns of migrants, especially that of females. To test this hypothesis I first construct a comprehensive typology that classifies all immigrants according to the timing of marriage and migration for each spouse, and their immigrant or native origin. Next, I examine the explanatory power of this typology by estimating the employment probability of migrants in multivariate logit regressions that include the resulting types of `family migrants' as independent. The obtained results confirm the theoretical and empirical utility of studying marriage and migration jointly in order to explain differences in the labour performance of immigrant women. Moreover, the main conclusions concerning cross-type differences in female labour behaviour remain valid ever after controlling for current legal status and legal status at entry, and running separate analyses for the main origin groups in Spain.},

Following critiques of traditional sociological and social psychological analyses of the household economy, it takes a more discursive approach, which enables identification of gender dynamics as one of the mechanisms through which decision-making in relation to this area of practice is accomplished.},

The underlying concept is that\textemdash in promoting civic skills\textemdash immigrants are better equipped to politically, socially and economically integrate. However, the question of whether civic integration is designed to be a real solution to repair integration problems has gone untested. This paper presents results, across a wide range of outcomes, which finds much more support for a symbolic narrative than a functional one. Using a unique data-set to measure civic integration policy across six waves of the European Social Survey (2002\textendash 2012), we find little evidence that these requirements produce tangible, long-term integration change. This does not diminish their significance; instead, we find requirements serve a meaningful gate-keeping role, while simultaneously repositioning the state closer to immigrant lives.},

The differences across conditioning variables within the same method do not exceed 3pp, but including more variables almost universally results in larger estimates of the adjusted wage gaps. Methods that account for common support and selection into employment yielded higher estimates of the adjusted wage gap. While the actual point estimates of adjusted wage gap are slightly different, all of them are roughly twice as high as the raw gap, which corroborates the policy relevance of this methodological study.},

Accordingly, we assess three institutional arenas: predistribution (rules and regulations that govern paid work), private redistribution (interhousehold transfers), and conventional public redistribution (operating via cash transfers and direct taxes). In each arena, we assess underlying policy logics, identify current policy controversies, summarize contemporary cross-national policy variation, and synthesize existing findings on policy effects. Our assessment of redistributional effects focuses on three core socioeconomic outcomes: low pay, child poverty, and income inequality. We close by assessing how the three institutional arenas perform collectively and by calling for further work on how these institutions change over time and how they affect subgroups differentially.},

The data were obtained from the European Union Labour Forces Survey 2008 Ad-Hoc Module for France, Belgium, UK and Sweden. In order to supplement the results from the country-specific analysis, we replicated the analysis using pooled data from the five rounds of the European Social Survey conducted between 2002 and 2010, for nine 'old immigration' Western European countries together. The analysis centered on two aspects of incorporation: labor force status and occupation. Multinominal, binary logistic as well as linear probability regression models were estimated. The findings suggest that in all countries non-European origin is associated with greater disadvantage in finding employment not only among first-generation immigrants, but also among sons and daughters of immigrants (i.e. second-generation). Moreover, the relative employment disadvantage among immigrant men of non-European origin is especially pronounced in the second-generation. The likelihood of attaining a high-status job is influenced mostly by immigrant status, regardless of region of origin and gender. The results of the study reveal that patterns of labor force incorporation vary considerably across origin groups and across generations. The patterns do not vary as much across countries, despite cross-country differences in welfare state regimes, migration integration policy and composition of migration flows.},

The data analysis is conducted within the framework of a hierarchical age-period-cohort model (HAPC) to estimate the dynamic relations between anti-immigrant sentiment and country's social and economic conditions, while taking into consideration variations across individuals and birth-cohorts. The analysis lends support to expectations derived from the `competitive threat' theoretical model. The findings show that a higher share of non-European ethnic minorities in the country's population is associated with a higher level of ant-immigrant attitudes. Anti-immigrant sentiment was found to be more pronounced in the `old immigration countries' than in the `new immigration countries.' The impact of economic conditions on anti-immigrant sentiment becomes evident through the effect of cohort in the `new immigration countries': cohorts that entered the labor market when the unemployment rate was high are likely to hold more negative attitudes toward immigrants.},

We elaborate the method first for the bidimensional case, using as dimensions income observed over two periods: one at the beginning and one at the end of a time span.

For this purpose, we make use of unique individual level micro data from the German socio-economic panel study. In married and cohabiting couples men's net worth, on average, is 33,000 euros higher than women's. We look at five different sets of factors (demographics, income, labor market, inheritances, financial decision-making in the partnership) that might explain this wealth gap. We find that all factors contribute to the explanation of the wealth gap within partnerships, with inheritances and income being particularly relevant. Furthermore, we find that specific characteristics (e.g., self-employment, no migration background, inheritances, high income) that decrease the wealth gap for women increase it for men. For men the respective coefficients are even stronger in absolute terms. When examining intra-partnership financial decision-making, we find the gap to be significantly smaller when the female partner manages the money and larger if the male partner has the last word in financial decisions.},

In order to quantify the impact of discrimination on poverty, it proposes the construction of a counterfactual distribution of wages where discrimination against women has been removed. Using this new wage distribution, the study computes total household income and compares poverty rates in the absence of discrimination to those actually observed. The results show that, in general, discrimination against women plays a determinative role in the current levels of poverty in EU countries, although results by country show that this role differs in intensity and pattern. Further, the study finds that in EU countries the effect of discrimination on poverty risk dramatically increases for individuals in households that largely depend on working women' earnings.},

Our findings show that labour market integration is relatively unproblematic for immigrants from Western countries, whereas immigrants from other countries, especially from Africa, Asia and Latin America, face substantial obstacles to earnings progress when entering the Swedish labour market. For the latter group of countries, extensive controls for general and country-specific human capital reduce the earnings differentials. However, the remaining gap is of a non-trivial magnitude.

In diesem Kapitel soll der im vorherigen Kapitel entwickelte multiple Armutsindikator f\"ur Trendanalysen genutzt werden, die von der langen Laufzeit des 1984 gestarteten SOEP Gebrauch machen. Gerade vor dem Hintergrund der kontroversen Diskussionen um die Trendentwicklung von Armut kann deutlich gemacht werden, worin der Erkenntnisgewinn eines kombinierten Armutsindikators besteht. Bislang konnte die Frage nicht empirisch beantwortet werden, ob sich hinter dem beobachtbaren Anstieg der Armutsquoten eine zunehmende Verfestigung von Armut im Sinne der dauerhaften Ausgrenzung einer (neuen) Unterschicht verbirgt, oder aber eine zunehmende Entgrenzung der Armut im Sinne einer zumindest tempor\"aren Prekarisierung breiter Bev\"olkerungsgruppen (8.1). Zur Kl\"arung dieser Frage mithilfe des \textemdash{} leicht modifizierten \textemdash{} kombinierten Armutsindikators werden gleitende 5-Jahres-Perioden gebildet (8.2), die es erlauben, die Entwicklungen in den unterschiedlichen Auspr\"agungen des Armutsindikators nachzuvollziehen (8.3). Abschlie\ss end werden vertiefende Analysen vorgestellt, die den zeitlichen Trends der Persistenz vs. Dynamik sowie der Konsistenz vs. Inkonsistenz von Ressourcenmangel und Deprivationen nachgehen (8.4).},

Five dimensions of poverty persistence are identified: The duration of poverty spells, cumulative deprivation in various life domains, social-structural concentration of poverty, spatial segregation of poverty and the intergenerational transmission of poverty. For four out of these five dimensions, it can be shown empirically that poverty has indeed become increasingly persistent over the last 20 years in Germany. This trend is still underestimated in public debates.},

Three mechanisms have been suggested to explain this relationship: a devaluation of women's work, a crowding of women into a limited number of occupations, and a female disadvantage in the accumulation of specific human capital. In this analysis, based on data from the Swedish Level of Living Survey of 2000 (n=2915), we distinguish between these mechanisms using measures of devaluation (Treiman's prestige scale), crowding (employee dependence on current employer) and specific human capital (on-the-job training). The results show that all the indicators are related to percent F, but not in a linear fashion, and that the percent F-effect on wages is overstated and misspecified. Female-dominated occupations stand out with lower wages than both male-dominated and gender-integrated occupations and this is not explained by any of our measures. Thus, if the hypotheses on segregation and wages should be sustained, they must be further specified and new measures must be found to prove their worth.},

By ignoring the heaping process a severe bias in terms of spikes and bumps is introduced when applying kernel density methods naively to the rounded data. A generalized Stochastic Expectation Maximization (SEM) approach accounting for heaping with potentially asymmetric rounding behaviour in univariate kernel density estimation is presented in this work. The introduced methods are applied to survey data of the German Socio-Economic Panel and exhibit very good performance simulations.},

Haven't academics been debating issues of measurement endlessly? Isn't it high time to stop debating and get on with the tasks of measuring poverty, developing policy, and taking action? We too would have hoped that by now a framework for measuring poverty and inequality would be as well developed as our sprawling and influential social indicator system for measuring total economic output. The unfortunate fact of the matter, however, is that a comprehensive and consensual framework is not in place, and such tools as now exist are not fully adequate to the task of representing the structure of poverty. The purpose of this chapter is to expose some of the assumptions about poverty measurement with which the disciplines of sociology and economics have been burdened, to show that these assumptions have not always served scholars in these disciplines well, and to develop a framework for poverty measurement that provides a more rigorously empirical foundation for measurement.},

The volume reviews key national experiences of immigration and citizenship laws, the use of integration and the 'moving of ideas' between national arenas. The framing of integration in immigration and citizenship law and the ways in which policy convergence is being achieved through the EU framework on integration raises a number of conceptual dilemmas and a set of definitional premises in need of reflection and consideration.},

We exploit M's additive decomposability property to pose the following two questions: (i) Is there an interaction effect? (ii) How much does each source contribute to occupational segregation, controlling for the effect of the other? Although the role of ethnicity is non-negligible in the areas where minorities are concentrated, our findings confirm the greater importance of gender over ethnicity as a source of segregation. Moreover, we find a small ``dwindling'' interaction effect between the two sources of segregation: ethnicity slightly weakens the segregating power of gender and vice versa.},

Further we take the heterogeneity of immigrants into account by separating them by country of origin. The rising wage inequality in Germany since the mid nineties will also be considered.

  abstract = {Women's employment is one of the most widely-discussed and often-misunderstood issues of modern society. Are women today oppressed, or do they have the best of both worlds? Do women have to go out to work to gain equality with men, or do they already do more than their share of domestic work, caring work and voluntary work as well as work in the informal economy? Do women seek careers on the same terms as men, or are they content to be dependent wives or secondary earners taking jobs on a short-term basis? How important is job segregation in explaining the 20\% pay gap between men and women? Have equal opportunities laws had any real impact? Are women in Europe lagging behind, or are they at the forefront of developments in modern societies? This new updated edition of Catherine Hakim's classic text addresses all the key issues currently debated in relation to women's work - in the domestic sphere, as well as paid employment. Dr Hakim tests the power of patriarchy theory and preference theory against economic theories. Sex discrimination, work-life balance, part-time work, flexible hours, homeworking, career patterns across the life cycle, labour mobility, labour turnover, the returns to education, occupational segregation, the pay gap, the glass ceiling, and the impact of European Union policies are all considered. Analysis of historical developments over the twentieth century, based on censuses, is complemented by case studies of people working in occupations undergoing dramatic change. Throughout the book, comparisons are drawn between the USA, Britain, other European countries, Canada, Australia, and also China, Japan and other Far Eastern societies. The analysis draws on sociology, economics, psychology, labour law, history and social anthropology to conclude that the diversity of women's life goals and lifestyle preferences is increasing. This explains the growing polarisation of women's employment and many contradictory recent research results.},

  abstract = {Aus individueller Sicht ist es ein schweres Los, in Armut leben zu m\"ussen. Aus der Sicht eines Sozialstaates stellt das Vorhandensein von Armen unter der Wohnbev\"olkerung die Verfehlung eines wichtigen sozialpolitischen Ziels dar. Diese beiden Perspektiven sind auch ma\ss geblich f\"ur den sozialstatistischen Diskurs; sie m\"ussen aber sorgf\"altig unterschieden werden. Soll einzelnen armen Menschen mit sozialstaatlichen Ma\ss nahmen geholfen werden, so ist die Voraussetzung hierf\"ur, dass sie identifiziert werden k\"onnen F\"ur den Sozialstaat als Akteur, der das Ziel der Armutsbek\"ampfung bzw. Armutsvermeidung mit allgemeinen Gesetzen oder anderen institutionellen Regelungen und Instrumenten verfolgt, gen\"ugt eine Statistik, die lediglich die Zahl, den Bev\"olkerungsanteil und die durchschnittliche ,,Schwere`` der Armutslage von anonym bleibenden Menschen aufzeigt. Au\ss erdem ist es wichtig, die Dauer von Armutslagen und das Ausma\ss{} der Aufstiege aus und der Abstiege in Armutslagen zu ermitteln. Dem Entstehen, dem Bestehenbleiben und dem Verschwinden von Armut liegen soziale Prozesse zugrunde. Auch hierbei ist zwischen der individuellen Sicht und der gesellschaftlichen Sicht zu unterscheiden. Ein Individuum kann in Armut absinken, es kann in Armut verharren oder es kann aus Armut in eine nicht mehr als arm zu kennzeichnende Lebenslage aufsteigen. Es kann auch in eine arme Familie hineingeboren werden oder aus dem Ausland zuwandern und arm sein oder die Armutslage durch Auswanderung oder durch Tod verlassen. Gesellschaftlich gesehen kann ein bestimmter Bev\"olkerungsanteil von Armen dauerhaft vorhanden sein, ohne dass dieselben Individuen dauerhaft arm bleiben m\"ussen. Es gen\"ugt, dass der Zustrom von Individuen in die Armut etwa dem Abstrom von Individuen aus der Armut entspricht. Damit sollte auch klar sein, dass man nur von armen Menschen sprechen sollte, aber nicht von armen Regionen, armen L\"andern, armen Schichten oder armen ethnischen Gruppen; denn diese Bezeichnungen w\"urden nur dann zutreffen, wenn man unterstellen k\"onnte, dass alle Individuen in einer Region, in einem Land oder in einer Gruppe als arm angesehen werden m\"ussen Es gibt in einem hochentwickelten Land vermutlich keine sozialen Prozesse, die zu einer derart geringen Heterogenit\"at f\"uhren. Der Zweck von Armutsgrenzen ist es, eine Unterscheidung zwischen Armen und Nicht-Armen treffen zu k\"onnen. Sie liegen daher explizit oder implizit allen \"Uberlegungen \"uber Armut in den Artikeln dieses Handbuchs zugrunde. Dabei stellen die beiden genannten Perspektiven unterschiedliche Anforderungen an die Ausgestaltung. Die deskriptive Klassifizierung von Personen als arm oder nicht arm ist eine Voraussetzung f\"ur weitergehende Ursachenanalysen.

Discrimination on the basis of ascriptive factors, such as social origins or ethnicity, is generally regarded to be a source of economic inefficiency and waste. More importantly, it is a source of social injustice and social exclusion. This book explores ethnic inequalities in the labour market, particularly with respect to access to jobs. It examines whether ethnic minorities compete on equal terms in the labour market with equally qualified members of the charter populations and focuses on the experiences of the `second generation', that is, the children of migrants who have themselves grown up and been educated in the countries of destination. In addition to the classic immigration countries of Australia, Canada, Israel, and the United States, the book also covers the major new immigration countries of Western Europe, such as Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, and Sweden, as well as South Africa.},

This study builds on earlier research by exploring how far religious affiliation can explain these inequalities.

We therefore estimate the effects by focusing on cases where ethnicity and religion cross-cut each other, excluding those groups where ethnicity and religion coincide. The results demonstrate a strong `Muslim penalty' for both women and men from different ethnic groups with respect to economic activity and unemployment. Furthermore, the apparent `ethnic' effects estimated for Pakistanis and Bangladeshis in models that do not control for religion prove to be similar in magnitude to the effect of Muslim religion estimated in models from which Pakistanis and Bangladeshis have been excluded.},

In some regions, the process started more than 40 years ago; in others the migration experience is much more recent. This study seeks to portray from a micro perspective the ongoing migration processes from Morocco, in particular to Western Europe. Emphasis is placed on the effect of family networks and migration culture on the intention to emigrate of Moroccan men and women without international migration experience. We focus especially on gender differences since the position and the roles played by men and women both within the family and within Moroccan society are very different. This gender distinction reveals remarkable differences between men and women in the intention to emigrate, and in its explanation. For men, emigration intentions are stronger in regions having a migration culture, while at the same time the presence of family networks abroad has a negative but small effect on the emigration intention. For women, however, the existence of a migration culture has no effect on the intention to leave the country, whereas family networks abroad tend to increase this intention. Interestingly, women with a paid job and who judge their financial situation negatively have the highest emigration intentions. This may indicate that, among Moroccan women, the more modernised, especially, intend to migrate. The more conservative Moroccan women are not likely to express an intention to migrate on their own. Rather, they behave in a manner that suits the husband or family. This behaviour may, or may not, include an emigration decision.},

This cross-national diversity in policies has supported a substantial body of research on the effect of different policy designs on women's labor market outcomes and, increasingly, on men's take-up of work-family provisions. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of this research and to draw out implications in terms of policy designs that seem to maximize women's labor force participation, narrow the gender gap in earnings, and increase men's participation in caregiving at home. The paper reviews the research literature on leave policies, flexible and/or alternative work arrangements and childcare supports, and highlights the implications of policy designs for male take-up. The paper then discusses the growing literature on adverse and unintended consequences of work-family policies for gender equality and concludes by highlighting gaps in current knowledge.},

The present study sets out to address this gap, and it has a particular focus on the relative utility of intra- and interethnic contacts. Applying social capital considerations, we investigate to what extent German first generation immigrants' relationships in terms of the ethnic composition of their friendships and family size influence their likelihood of income poverty, net of various other factors. We furthermore ask whether the returns on interethnic contacts are dependent on immigrants' host country language proficiency, a pivotal type of cultural competence. Using the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, we find that both types of social relationships help to reduce poverty, which diverges from previous findings for labor market outcomes. Moreover, the utility of interethnic relationships varies according to language proficiency. These results illustrate the complex interrelations between cultural, social and economic integration, and they help to advance our understanding about the potential benefits of intra- and interethnic social capital by showing that both are useful in averting immigrant income poverty.},

It builds on the pioneering study by Dang, Lanjouw, Luoto, and McKenzie (Journal of Development Economics, 2014) providing bounds estimates and the innovative refinement proposed by Dang and Lanjouw (World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 6504, 2013) providing point estimates of the statistics of interest. We provide new evidence about the accuracy of synthetic panel estimates relative to benchmarks based on estimates derived from genuine household panel data, employing high quality data from Australia and Britain, while also examining the sensitivity of results to a number of analytical choices. Overall, we are more agnostic about the validity of the synthetic panel approach applied to these two rich countries than are earlier validity studies in their applications focusing on middle- and low-income countries.},

Previous studies of the impact of underemployment on well-being have tended to focus on a single country or occupational group and have examined single dimensions of underemployment. This article, by contrast, examines experiences across several European economies and explores two different dimensions of underemployment: the gap between hours of work and workers' desired hours and the underutilisation of their skills and abilities. The article uses data from the 2015 European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) and explains the consequences of underemployment for well-being by drawing on the international comparative political economy literature, particularly the theorisation and analysis of comparative employment and welfare regimes. We find that while underemployment is generally associated with lower levels of well-being, the nature and strength of relationships between different dimensions of underemployment and well-being vary between employment regimes. The article also highlights the detrimental consequences of `overemployment' for workers' well-being, and shows that the well-being of women tends to be lower than that of men, regardless of employment regime.},

Cross-national studies are rare and have predominantly included Northern and Western European countries, the United States, and Canada. OBJECTIVE This study explains the higher likelihood of cohabiters to keep income separate by selection as well as commitment factors and explores country differences, including countries from Central and Eastern Europe. METHODS Using data from the Generations and Gender Surveys of Bulgaria, France, Georgia, Germany, Romania, and Russia, N=41,456 cohabiting and married individuals are studied. Binary logistic regression models of the likelihood that respondents keep money separate are calculated. RESULTS Across countries, higher education, female labor market participation, both partners being employed, short union duration, absence of joint children, presence of separation thoughts, and (for cohabiters) a lack of marital intentions are the most persistent correlates of keeping money separate. Differences between cohabiters and married couples are reduced when selection and commitment are taken into account, but are still significant. Cross-national variation in the effect of cohabitation on keeping separate purses is persistent. CONCLUSION Different money management strategies of cohabiters and spouses can be explained to some extent by selection processes and inherent differences in the level of commitment within cohabitation and marriage. Countries also differ in the socio-economic context and norms concerning the way intimate relationships are organized which might lead to persistent differences in the way cohabiting and married couples organize their income.]},

The main focus is on the theory, empirical application, and results of the currently dominant collective models, but the authors also look at developments that led up to them and some subsequent extensions and alternative approaches.

Longitudinal analysis of the data indicates that much of the remaining gap reflects worker heterogeneity, evidenced by small wage gains and losses among workers switching between part-time and full-time jobs. The lower skills of part-time than full-time workers result primarily from limited work experience and accumulation of human capital. Little evidence can be found of a large wage gap between part-time and full-time women. A part-time wage penalty is found for men, but men account for less than one-third of total part-time employment.},

We analyze unemployment and employment durations of male and female migrants, as well as transitions from domestic work to employment for female migrants from Turkey, former Yugoslavia, Greece, Spain and Italy. Given the large gap in unemployment and employment rates between groups of migrants, we look at several economic, human capital and cultural factors in order to test whether migrant-specific characteristics can help to explain ethnic group differences in labour market outcomes, The migrant-specific cultural variables we investigate include host-country language proficiency, interethnic contacts, host-country media consumption, and religiosity. The results indicate that although labour market transitions of migrants strongly depend on the labour market context, host-country orientation and religiosity also have some impact on the labour market integration of individual migrants, especially on transitions into employment of male migrants and married migrant housewives. However; while for most of our cultural variables we find significant effects on the individual level, these factors do not help to clarify the differences among the different migrant groups, which persist at a similar level even after controlling for labour market, general human capital, as well as cultural variables.},

In examining this variation, our article contributes to the nascent literature on the impact of welfare states on immigrants. We hypothesize that whether immigrants benefit from welfare generosity depends on three intervening factors: immigration policy, labor market regulation, and welfare eligibility rules. We use fuzzy-set analysis to examine the interplay of these determinants in 16 West-European states. The findings show that in most countries a high migrant disadvantage results from the combination of a large share of humanitarian and family immigrants and generous social policies. The underlying mechanism is that ``unwanted'' immigrants are institutionally impeded from full access to generous welfare states.},

However, among the children of immigrants, child poverty increased steadily and rapidly from about 12\% in 1970 to 33\% in the late 1990s before declining to about 21\% in 2000. Using 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 Public Use Microdata Samples data, we identified key factors that underlie the fluctuations in immigrant child poverty from 1969 to 1999 and the divergence from children of natives. We found that roughly half the absolute increase in immigrant child poverty can be linked to changing conditions in the U.S. economy that make it more difficult to lift a family out of poverty than 30 years ago. These changes occurred disproportionately among children of parents with lower levels of education, employment, and U.S. experience but not among racial/ethnic minorities. Poverty risks among various racial and ethnic groups converged over time. The relative increase in poverty for immigrant versus native children owes largely to the divergence between immigrant and native families in racial/ethnic composition, parental education, and employment.},

Furthermore, the definition of the observed characteristics matters: merely including their current values (as frequently seen in wage decompositions) entails smaller explained and larger unexplained components than when including both their current values and histories in the analysis. Given the sensitivity of our results, we advise caution when using wage decompositions for policy recommendations.},

(UNDP, 2003; UN Statistics Division, 2004). This inadequate progress raises important questions about the policies and strategies adopted to achieve poverty reduction, as well as about key international issues, including aid, debt, trade and conflict reduction. It also raises important questions about our very conception and understanding of poverty. While perspectives on poverty have evolved significantly over this period, with widespread acceptance of the multidimensional nature of poverty, and of the importance of considering the depth and severity of poverty, there has been slower progress in recognising and responding to the persistence of much poverty over time (Clark and Hulme, 2005); in other words, the phenomenon of chronic poverty. For many people poverty is not a transitory experience or a seasonal problem: it is a situation from which escape is very difficult, most emphatically illustrated by deprivation which is transmitted from one generation to the next. At present, chronic poverty is still not seen as a distinct and important policy focus. This is a significant area of neglect both because a substantial proportion of poverty is likely to be chronic (CPRC, 2004), and because it is likely to call for distinct or additional policy responses that can tackle deep structural obstacles.},

  abstract = {This study provides new evidence on the levels of economic integration experienced by foreigners and naturalised immigrants relative to native Germans from 1994 to 2015. We decompose the wage gap using the method for unconditional quantile regression models by employing a regression of the (recentered) influence function (RIF) of the gross hourly wage on a rich set of explanatory variables. This approach enables us to estimate contributions made across the whole wage distribution. To allow for a detailed characterization of labour market conditions, we consider a comprehensive set of socio-economic and labour-related aspects capturing influences of, e.g., human capital quality, cultural background, and the personalities of immigrants. The decomposition results clearly indicate a significant growing gap with higher wages for both foreigners (13.6 to 17.6 \%) and naturalised immigrants (10.0 to 16.4 \%). The findings further display a low explanation for the wage gap in low wage deciles that is even more pronounced within immigrant subgroups. Cultural and economic distances each have a significant influence on wages. A different appreciation of foreign educational qualifications, however, widens the wage gap substantially by 4.5 ppts on average. Moreover, we observe an indication of deterioration of immigrants' human capital endowments over time relative to those of native Germans.},

Problems with the interpretations embedded in the capability approach are pinpointed and adjustments proposed. Drawing on the vast literature on household behavior in developing countries, the author argues that capabilities have a distinctly interdependent dimension. While the discussion of agency in the capability approach has been either normative or policy-oriented, exercises that seek to evaluate individual well-being should pay more attention to the existence of alternative types of power within the realm of the household.},

This definition views poverty as a social relation which according to general opinion regards the right for support and aid as being an established right. Following social exchange theory, the demand for aid is being interpreted as a disturbance of social reciprocity. Finally it is shown in this paper how the knowledge of right for support affects the relation between support\'ees and supporters.},

In many high-income countries, poverty lines are explicitly relative, set as a share of mean or median income. Despite systematic variation in how countries define poverty, global poverty counts are based on fixed-value lines. To reflect national assessments of poverty in a global headcount of poverty, this paper proposes a societal poverty line. The proposed societal poverty line is derived from 699 harmonized national poverty lines, and has an intercept of \$1 per day and a relative gradient of 50 percent of median national income or consumption. The societal poverty line is more closely aligned with national definitions of poverty than other proposed relative lines. By this relative measure, societal poverty has fallen steadily since 1990, but at a much slower pace than absolute extreme poverty.},

This study documents the magnitude of four types of underemployment experienced by both native-born minority and ethnic immigrant male and female workers in the United States and tests a ``double disadvantage'' economic outcome hypothesis that minority workers tend to be channeled into secondary-sector jobs and that immigrant workers face initial disadvantages in labor force assimilation. Method. Data for men and women aged 25-64 who are in the labor force and not attending school were derived from the 1990 Census Bureau Public Use Microdata Sample. Multinomial logistic regression procedures were used to estimate the effect of minority group membership and immigrant status on the odds of unemployment, part-time employment, working poverty, and job mismatch, relative to adequate employment. Results. Descriptive results showed greater overall underemployment among females than males. Blacks and Hispanics had higher unemployment and working-poverty rates compared to non-Hispanic whites and Asians, with job mismatch highest among Asians. Immigrant underemployment was greater than that of the native-born. Asians posted the largest disparity in immigrant versus native-born underemployment, and blacks had the smallest. Multivariate models showed that minority group effects were stronger than immigrant status effects in predicting underemployment. Increased likelihood of underemployment across the different minority groups versus non-Hispanic white workers was not fully accounted for by the expected influences of human-capital, demographic, industry, and occupational variables. Conclusion. The double disadvantage hypothesis of minority group and immigrant status is accepted only for Asian men and women with jobs mismatched to their skills and for Asian women, who are most likely to be unemployed or be among the working poor.},

It is argued that civic integration converges cross-nationally with respect to policy goals and instruments, while extant variation is often incoherent or touching more on the form than the substance of policy; that civic integration is national-level policy that tends to coexist with ongoing de facto multiculturalism, especially at local level; and that civic integration mostly remains in a liberal register, as it is still integration and not assimilation, which would connote forced identity change.},

But is there a difference between these couples or not? And are the assumptions made about each type of couple accurate? Our research suggests that the division of assets within couples is complex with formal, legal ownership of assets (housing, pensions, savings) and debts not always matching participants' `perceptions' of who owns them.

Results indicated that whereas traditional gender role orientation was positively related to earnings, gender significantly predicted the slope of this relationship: Traditional gender role orientation was strongly positively associated with earnings for men; it was slightly negatively associated with earnings for women. Occupational segregation partly explained these gender differences. Overall, the results suggest that although gender role attitudes are becoming less traditional for men and for women, traditional gender role orientation continues to exacerbate the gender wage gap.

The GID-DB thereby permits analysis of hypotheses that link cultural practices to gender equality, human development and economic growth. A cross-country comparison of the data indicates that inequalities in social institutions are particularly pronounced in countries with low female literacy rates, but correlate less strongly with Gross Domestic Product per capita. Similarly, our econometric analysis suggests a clearly negative correlation between gender inequality of the OECD Development Center and women's labor-force participation.*The views expressed in this article are the personal opinions of the authors *The views expressed in this article are the personal opinions of the authors},

Results show that the employment of recently arrived immigrant women makes a notable contribution to lifting families out of poverty. Moreover, the wide ethnic variations in the probability of exit from poverty between European and non-European groups are partially explained by the lower employment rates among non-European women. The results suggest that the equal earner/female breadwinner model applies to low-income recent immigrant families in general, but the male breadwinner model explains the low probability of poverty exit among select non-European groups whose female employment rates are notably low.},

Using the EULFS 2000 ad hoc module on school-to-work transitions, a comparative event-history analysis of entry into stable higher status employment is conducted for two European countries, Belgium and Spain. These countries differ considerably in their immigration contexts and patterns of school-to-work transitions, requiring different hypotheses about the relevance of the self-exclusion mechanism. The results show that in Belgium ethnic penalties for nonEU immigrants exist and remain constant irrespective of the length of the job search. In Spain the gap between non-EU immigrants and the native-born is even more pronounced and, importantly, increases significantly over time. This leads to the conclusion that discrimination seems to be relevant in both contexts and that self-exclusion resulting from early abandonment of job search activities is a further important factor in Spain.},

We show that answers given by different members of the household bring pertinent information on income sharing and utility in the household. In particular, we find a significant effect of the female\textendash male wage ratio in reported income perception and satisfaction differentials between household members. Our data covers the transition period (1994\textendash 2003) characterized by massive economic and social changes in Russia. We investigate the evolution of intra-household welfare distribution by exploiting the episode of the financial crisis of 1998 to distinguish two periods: pre- and post-crisis. Our empirical strategy consists of applying probit-type models allowing the parameters to change in a discrete manner between two periods and accounting for discrete unobserved heterogeneity.},

Previous studies have paid little attention to how gender segregation shapes underemployment, an increasingly prominent feature of the UK and European labour markets since the economic crisis of 2008. Using data from the UK Annual Population Surveys, this article examines time-related underemployment: people working part time because they cannot find a full-time job. The article asks whether there are gender differences in underemployment trends and in the links between underemployment and subjective well-being. The results suggest that the probability of underemployment is growing at a faster rate among women rather than men and that underemployment is most common in the jobs that women are more likely to perform, namely in female-dominated occupations, the public sector and small organizations. Underemployment is least common in male-dominated occupations and industries and in the private sector. Moreover, for employees with longer tenures, underemployment has more negative relationships with the subjective well-being of women than with that of men. These findings imply that gender segregation in labour markets is a crucial factor to consider when researching underemployment and its consequences.},

We find savings are more commonly held in joint names than investments or debts and there is evidence of an increasing independence in financial arrangements between couple members throughout the period 1995 to 2005. Controlling for age and other factors, cohabitation reduces the likelihood of shared financial arrangements. Both partners' labour market income affects the likelihood of having any savings or investments for both men and women but as men's labour income increases, the likelihood of men having jointly held savings and investments with their female partner reduces. Psychological well-being is improved where individuals have any savings or investments either solely or jointly held with their partner.},

Results show that contacts with family, friends and neighbours and being active as a volunteer have no significant effect on employment for both immigrant men and women.

In Canada, however, little research has been done on this issue, and that has left mixed results. The present study attempts to address the economic performance of immigrants in Canada through an examination of their poverty status. This is particularly important now because, since the late 1980s, many industrial nations including Canada have been subjected to an unexpected surge of poverty known as `new poverty.' The findings indicate that immigrants in Canada are consistently overrepresented among the poor; that their poverty rates are particularly high in larger cities, which have larger concentrations of immigrants; and that among immigrants, the poverty rates are higher for visible minorities, who are mostly recent immigrants. One particularly surprising finding was that the second-generation immigrants, who were expected to outperform their parents, had higher poverty rates. A series of logistic regression models are developed to shed some light on the possible reasons behind these trends. Of the three sets of potential contributors \textendash{} human capital, assimilation and structural factors \textendash{} the first two were found more relevant. The models also revealed that the human capital factors were less rewarding for immigrants than natives.},

Findings reveal the largest poverty gaps in Sweden and demonstrate that this is due to immigrants' comparatively severe labor market disadvantages. However, underlying poverty levels are also lowest in Sweden because of a two-pronged policy strategy of enabling work (particularly among women, immigrant and native-born alike) and reducing poverty through income support. Thus, immigrants in Sweden live at lower levels of poverty than their immigrant counterparts elsewhere, despite facing higher levels of inequality vis-\`a-vis native-born Swedes.

  abstract = {In the context of increasing women's labour force participation (LFP) across Western countries, there remain large differences in LFP for women of different ethnic origins. While existing research has demonstrated that part of these differences can be attributed to compositional differences (age, qualifications, family context etc.) and to differences in gender role attitudes and religiosity, residual `ethnic effects' typically remain. Further insight into the drivers of such differences has the potential to inform us about factors shaping women's LFP more widely. In this paper we exploit a largescale longitudinal study of the UK to investigate ethnic differences in both LFP entry and exit probabilities. We examine how far we can account for overall ethnic differences in LFP entry and exit, taking account of individual characteristics, gender role attitudes and religiosity, and the contribution of relevant life-course events. We find that, adjusting for all these factors, Indian and Caribbean women do not differ from White majority women in their labour force entry and exit probabilities but that Pakistani and Bangladeshi women are less likely to enter and more likely to exit the labour market, while Black African women have higher entry rates. We also find that Pakistani and Bangladeshi women's labour market entries and exits are less sensitive to partnership and child-bearing events than other women's.},

Low maternal employment in migrant populations raises questions on family policy uptake among mothers of migrant origin. This study documents differences in parental leave uptake between native and migrant mothers of different origin groups and generations, and assesses the extent to which precarious employment trajectories can account for these differentials. Using longitudinal data from Belgian social security registers, mixed-effects logit models of leave uptake, full-time or part-time leave uptake and the labour market position following leave are estimated for 10,976 mothers who entered parenthood between 2004 and 2010. Results indicate that uptake of parental leave is lower among mothers of migrant origin, since they fail to meet the eligibility criteria as a result of being overrepresented in unstable labour market positions. Whereas differential leave uptake can be accounted for by non-universal eligibility and precarious labour market trajectories, migrant-native differentials in part-time uptake and labour market positions following leave persist when controlling for pre-birth employment characteristics. The differential pattern of leave uptake among first-generation migrant women, in particular, is not explained by pre-birth employment characteristics, as they remain overrepresented in full-time leave, and first-generation mothers of non-European origin more frequently retreat from the labour force following leave. We conclude that difficult access to stable employment and non-universal eligibility are major factors explaining migrant-native differentials in parental leave use. As such, Belgian parental leave policies perpetuate labour market disadvantages by limiting support for work\textendash family reconciliation to those already established in the labour force.},

The women faced administrative obstacles in accessing the formal labour market; their overall initial poor financial status and family situation pressured them to accept work in the informal labour market. Another barrier was the limited ability to convert their cultural capital into economic capital. To overcome these barriers, the women adopted two distinct strategies of economic integration. The Ukrainian women used networks built on strong ties from country of origin and on weak ties in Poland, while the Vietnamese women used strong ties within their own ethnic niche.},

  abstract = {Students of European migration have been hampered by the legacy of those established forms of migration which have been historically most important \textendash{} settler migrations from Europe to the Americas, guest-worker migrations from the Mediterranean Basin to Northern Europe, and refugee migrations after the World Wars. We need to appreciate that many of the key questions that were asked to frame our understanding of the functioning of migration now have a very different array of answers from the largely economic ones which shaped our earlier analyses. Now, new mobility strategies are deployed to achieve economic and, importantly, non-economic objectives. In the new global and European map of migration, the old dichotomies of migration study \textendash{} internal versus international, forced versus voluntary, temporary versus permanent, legal versus illegal \textendash{} blur as both the motivations and modalities of migration become much more diverse. In offering an overview of the new typologies and geographies of international migration in Europe, this paper will be less a rigorous cartography than a qualitative exploration of a changing typology including migrations of crisis, independent female migration, migration of skilled and professional people, student migration, retirement migration and hybrid tourism\textendash migration. These relatively new forms of migration derive from new motivations (the retreat from labour migrations linked to production), new space\textendash time flexibilities, globalisation forces, and migrations of consumption and personal self-realisation. More than ever, this multiplex nature of human migration and spatial mobility demands an interdisciplinary approach, enriched wherever possible by comparative studies.

A wide range of types of migration can be observed in this region: large-scale emigration in many countries, recent mass immigration in the case of Greece, return migration, internal migration, internal and external forced migration, irregular migration, brain drain etc. These migratory phenomena occur within the context of EU migration policies and EU accession for some countries. Yet within this shifting migration landscape of migrant stocks and flows, the fundamental economic geography of different wealth levels and work opportunities is what drives most migration, now as in the past. This paper sets the scene for the special issue in three ways: first, by defining the three key concepts of migration, transnationalism and development; second, by setting the geographical scene, with the aid of relevant statistics on the migration, development and remittance trends in the various countries of the region; and third, by summarizing the highlights of the papers in this issue of the journal, which range in their coverage from Ukraine and Moldova in the north, to Greece and Albania in the south.},

Voluntary short part-time work is significantly less gendered, typically representing marginal labour force affiliation, combined with education or gradual retirement, which employers use for flexibility in low-skilled service and care industries.

We then use data from the 2012 Indian Human Development Survey to create a standard household-based MPIs closely related to the MPI proposed by Alkire and Santos (2014) as well as UNDP (2014), and compare that to an individual level MPI that individualizes education and nutrition and some aspects of the living standards dimensions.   We find that the poverty rate of females is 14 percentage points higher than that of men in our individual MPI measure but only 2 percentage points higher when using the household-based measure. Similarly, the age differentials in poverty are much larger using the individual-based measure. Using a decomposable inequality measure, we find the contribution of intrahousehold inequality to the total inequality in the individual deprivation score inequality to be 30\% and total inequality is also some 30\% higher using the individual-based measure, while inequality among the poor is found to be 5\% smaller using the individual measure.},

Further, in 40 percent of these families with migration history only the father pursued an occupational activity (Statistisches Bundesamt, 2012a). Migration based differences in labor market behavior are mainly explained by highlighting the importance of demographic characteristics, like educational attainment and family composition, and structural variables, such as differences in the institutional and economic environment in the country of origin, assimilation, and social integration as well as the number of years since migration. Instead of focusing on individual and structural determinants of employment choices alone, the main thesis of this paper is that cultural norms regarding existing gender role models within society may play a major role for labor market decisions, especially for females.},

The paper revisits theoretical arguments about religious participation as an ethnic investment strategy or, alternatively, as a bridge to the societal mainstream. Drawing on the longitudinal dataset produced in the international survey project on `Socio-cultural Integration Processes among New Immigrants in Europe' (SCIP), the paper puts these arguments to a rigorous test by analyzing effects of involvement in religious communities on employment and by scrutinizing channeling effects of the ethnic composition of religious congregations for recent migrants' entry into mainstream versus ethnic niche economies. The paper finds only limited support for either of the two arguments, suggesting that religious participation is structurally decoupled from socio-economic integration. However, persisting net employment gaps between recent Christian and Muslim immigrants might indicate the existence of religiously marked and socio-economically consequential boundaries in Western Europe.},

  abstract = {Despite being the dominant mode of legal entry for the past two decades in European Union states, the study of family migration has been marginalised theoretically, methodologically and empirically. In settler societies, family migration has been interpreted more loosely and has been encouraged. The definition of who constitutes the family is determined by the state and is generally interpreted in highly restrictive terms in EU states. Family-related migration has been neglected because of the emphasis in migration studies on the individual, a heavily economic focus, and an association with female migration based on the dichotomy of male producer and female reproducer. In policy terms it is treated as a secondary form of migration subordinate to and divorced from labour markets. However since the late 1980s family-related migrations have become the subject of scholarly research, especially North American and Asian-Pacific, using network analysis and, more recently, concepts of transnationalism. In this paper I firstly explore the reasons for the relative neglect of family-linked migration in European research which has focused on the integration of migrant families in receiving societies and the legal and policy conditions of family reunification. Secondly, I examine some of the implications of changing family-led migration, especially at key moments and stages of the lifecourse, and the increasing restrictions imposed on this form of migration, highlighting the continuing role of the nation-state.},

  abstract = {This article focuses on gendered discourses in integration policy and the problems immigrants pose in the reproduction of inequalities in a number of European countries. There has been little consideration of how gender categories operate in relation to broader political discourses around the construction of `us' and `them' and the constitution of national social and political communities and identities. Yet gender issues have become significant in the backlash against multiculturalism and gender and sexual relations have moved to the centre of debates about the necessity to enforce integration, if not assimilation. The first section outlines recent developments in the immigration-integration nexus in different European states. The second section draws out some of the reasons for the focus on family migration and spouses who are seen as the main importers of the `backward' practices and with `doubtful' parenting practices for future generations of citizens. The third section tackles the shift of current debates about integration of migrant women from the periphery, where they were largely invisible or mere appendages of men, to the centre, where they have acquired in the process a heightened, though not necessarily positive, visibility. Too often, representations of migrant women are based on a homogenised image of uneducated and backward migrants as victims of patriarchal cultures, legitimizing in this way the use of immigration controls to reduce the numbers entering and to tackle broader social issues, as has clearly been the case with forced marriages. Furthermore, the more discourses focus on Muslim women and Islam as inimical to European societies, the more the debate becomes culturalised and marginalises the socio-economic dimension of integration and the structural inequalities migrants face. Thus pre-entry tests may have less to do with integration than with a desire to reduce the flow of marriage migrants or to raise their human capital.},

The career paths of labor migrants from Turkey remain extremely dissimilar to those of Germans, even when differences in the age structure and the educational level are taken into account. Long and frequent unemployment are among the factors contributing to this dissimilarity. Immigrants, particularly Turks, are not only more likely to be long-term unemployed, they are also pushed into unskilled occupations.

Despite their high levels of formal education, these immigrants coming mostly from Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East face severe integration problems in the German labour market. Thus, after taking into account the value of human capital represented by these immigrants, their ethnic disadvantages appear to increase. This stands in sharp contrast with the disadvantages faced by ``classic'' immigrants who arrived in Germany during the 1960s and 1970s, for whom lack of human capital had been identified as the main obstacle to labour market integration.},

The analyses are performed with the help of a unique dataset comprised of recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union in Germany. Sequence analysis techniques and multivariate regressions are applied. Results show that starting in higher-status employment leaves a distinguishable imprint on immigrants' later occupational standings, even after the returns to the skills associated with early trajectories are taken into account. At the same time, initial career trajectories do not have any direct effect on wages, apart from the pay-off to relevant skills acquired while pursuing these careers. The findings are discussed in concurrence with the human capital and signalling theories.},

Americans are more likely than Germans to enter poverty after any of the four events, yet they also recover more quickly from job loss and family dissolution. Comparisons over time do not indicate a secular rise in the impact of critical life events on poverty risks, but our results show that poverty trajectories are subject to stronger cyclical fluctuations in the United States: Through its emphasis on market mechanisms, the liberal American welfare state raises the importance of (re-)employment opportunities for coping with the consequences of adverse life events. The absence of clear long-term trends leads to a reassessment of common views about welfare state change such as Jacob Hacker's thesis of a ``Great Risk Shift'' or the notion of an ``Americanization'' of Continental European welfare states. So far, there is also little evidence that the often claimed recalibration of welfare states towards ``new social risks'' has alleviated the adverse economic consequences of family dissolution.},

Data from the scientific use files of the German micro-censuses for the years 1976 to 2004 show that the part-time and marginal employment rates of mothers have increased, while full-time employment rates have declined. Reductions in full-time employment are most pronounced among less educated mothers, resulting in growing educational differences in the employment of mothers.},

  abstract = {Since the middle of the last decade, the notion of `migrants being unwilling to integrate' (Integrationsunwillig) - and sometimes, in a more active form, of `migrants refusing to integrate' (Integrationsverweigernd) - has increasingly come into focus in migration and integration debates in Germany. Pointing to the commitment of migrants to cultural val- ues that might be contradictory to values in the receiving society \textemdash{} for instance, gender equality \textemdash{} the `refusal of migrants to integrate' notion is aimed mainly at Turkish and other Muslim populations. However, as will be demonstrated below, it actually embraces the whole migrant population. Despite the nebulosity of these notions, politicians have presented quantifications of the `unwillingness' of migrants to integrate ranging from 40 per cent of the migrant population, as the president of the Committee for Home Affairs of the Federal Parliament maintained (Bosbach, 2009), and 10 to 15 per cent, according to the Minister of Interior De Maiziere (Bundesweites Integrationsprogramm, 2010). Oth- ers contradicted these statistics by pointing to the figure of 98 per cent of newcomer migrants attending integration courses, thus demonstrat- ing a willingness to integrate (Bade, 2010). In line with the spirit of the neo-liberal ideology that highlights the responsibility of the individual for her/his situation and fate, this assumption emerged and stabilized within the framework of a public discourse marked by hostility towards migrants, spreading moral panic and legitimizing a more restrictive and Controlling integration policy.},

The label `ethnic penalties' is often used to denote these gaps and reflects the idea that differences between natives and immigrants that cannot be explained by demographic and human capital variables must be due to discrimination by employers. I challenge this interpretation by looking at the role of sociocultural variables such as language proficiency, interethnic social ties and gender values as alternative sources of unexplained ethnic group differences. I use the data from the cross-national `Eurislam' survey of four immigrant ethnic groups of predominantly Muslim belief\textemdash Turks, Moroccans, former Yugoslav Muslims and Pakistani\textemdash as well as native ethnics. The results indicate that once sociocultural variables are taken into account, differences in rates of labour market participation and unemployment between native ethnics and the Muslim groups are strongly reduced and in many cases become statistically insignificant. Using mediation analyses, I demonstrate that the findings do not fit a scenario that assumes that the causality primarily flows from labour market participation to sociocultural assimilation rather than the other way around.},

The multicultural paradigm was first displaced in the Netherlands following the entry into force of the 1998 Newcomer Integration Act, which required newcom- ers to attend language and `social orientation' courses. Following the Dutch initiative and New Labour's Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which tightened naturalization requirements by introducing a test on `sufficient knowledge about life in the United Kingdom' in addition to language proficiency, the `civic integration paradigm' has taken root in Europe over the last six years. All `old migration coun- tries',1 with the exception of Belgium and France, require applicants for naturalization to take civic orientation tests, and pre-existing lan- guage requirements have been tightened and reinforced. Migrants are also required to attend language and civic orientation courses and, in most cases, to sit integration tests, in order to enter and/or obtain perma- nent residence in the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the UK. Non-attendance of integration courses affects their access to social benefits in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, France and the UK.},

Background International migration has evolved into a common experience for couples around the globe. Previous research has focused on the internal migration of couples and families. This article is the first to consider couples' international migration decisions drawing on the theoretical concepts of Mincer's tied migration theory and gender role beliefs. Method Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Survey, this study explores the labor market integration of tied, lead, and equal immigrants. Labor market integration is measured in terms of the probability to be employed and the time to first employment in Germany. The author investigates these outcomes via differences-in-differences and survival analysis regression techniques. Results Male tied, relative to lead and equal immigrants, are significantly less likely to be employed shortly after migration as well as in the long run. By contrast, no significant differences in the employment probability showed between female tied migrants and their reference groups after migration. Yet, lead migrants of both genders enter the German labor market earlier than tied as well as equal movers. Conclusion This study provides the first evidence on the significance of circumstances in couples' migration decisions making for (gender-specific) returns to migration and in that highlights key aspects of international couple migration.},

  abstract = {Development is a multidimensional concept incorporating diverse social, economic, cultural and political dimensions and economic growth, though necessary, is not sufficient in itself to bring about development in this broad sense. According to Nobel Prize Laureate Amartya Sen (for example, Sen, 1985, 1999), the basic purpose of development is to enlarge people's choices so that they can lead the life they want to. In this approach, the choices are termed `capabilities' and the actual levels of achievement attained in the various dimensions are called `functionings'. Thus human development is the enhancement of the set of choices or capabilities of individuals whereas functionings are a set of `beings' and `doings' which are the results of a given choice. The concept of human development proposed by Mahbub ul Haq, in the first Human Development Report in 1990 (see UNDP, 1990), largely inspired by Sen's various works, represents a major step ahead in the concretization of this extended meaning of development and in the effort to bring people's lives to the centre of thinking and analysis. Since then, human development and human deprivation have been the object of extensive theoretical and empirical research. They have been studied from various angles: conceptual, methodological, operational and policy making. As it is not possible to directly observe and measure human development in its broad sense or the lack of it, they are generally constructed as composite indices based on several variables (indicators).},

The article provides a test of those arguments in the area of school performance. Based on data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study, indicators of community-based social capital are shown to account for considerable interethnic differences in school performance. The results challenge notions that ethnic communities are generally supportive of the second generation's school performance, while contact with oppositional cultures of domestic minorities is the main cause of lower than average achievement. They support a conditional view of ethnic communities: the extent to which immigrant families' insertion into ethnic communities can support the school performance of their children depends on the communities' socioeconomic profile and level of aspirations.},

In this paper, we apply a dynamic panel data estimator (system GMM) to account for both unobserved confounders and reverse causality. Despite some evidence for health selection, we still find strong support for the causality thesis. Furthermore, we show that the adverse health effect is partially explained by the loss of self-perceived social status due to unemployment but not by the loss of household income or social contacts.},

The objective of this paper is to provide new micro-data-based evidence on the structural pattern of return migration. We use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel and employ a flexible semiparametric model, which allows us to estimate bivariate interaction effects. This enables us to analyze variation in emigration behavior over the life cycle. For the majority of migrants, we find that return migration is highly likely during the transition into retirement, implying that migrants spend their savings and pensions in their home country. For labor migrants, return migration intensifies the skill selection of the original immigration flow. Furthermore, we find a strong influence of family characteristics on return migration. Our analysis demonstrates that outmigration is influenced by economic and non-economic factors and highlights that migrants incorporate the mobility costs of family members into their individual return decisions.},

  abstract = {The 2008 global economic crisis has had profound social and economic consequences across states. In addition to cross-national social and economic disparities, the crisis generated increased domestic divisions between labor market insider and outsider groups. This article analyzes the impact of the global economic crisis on female workers across advanced welfare states. While considerable attention has been given to the impact of the Great Recession on financial markets and employment sectors, we argue that the crisis had an important gendered effect across advanced capitalist states that remains significantly underexplored. In particular, we examine the divergent ways in which distinct welfare systems and their cultural underpinnings shape labor market access and levels of social protection for women. In this endeavor, we integrate literature on welfare systems, feminist political economy and financial crisis to examine the relationship between social protection structures, cultural legacies and gender inequalities \textendash{} which manifests most strongly during times of economic crisis. Our hierarchical panel model of 28 countries across 7 years is supplemented by cultural and survey data. Our findings not only give an important analysis of an understudied aspect of the global economic crisis, but also provide policy implications for more gender-conscious crisis management responses going forward.},

To do this, we split the overall period of interest into a set of six-year long rolling windows and use them to document changes in the incidence and length of poverty episodes over time. A joint modeling of poverty and non-poverty spells controlling for unobserved heterogeneity is applied within each window in order to uncover how poverty experiences of individuals with different socio-economic characteristics have evolved over time. The results indicate that poverty has become more persistent and recurrent in Germany since the beginning of the 1990s. Individuals living in households whose head is a citizen from a European Union country, or has general or vocational training, partially improved their situation over time whereas those over 55 years old, households with a disabled or uneducated head, and single parent households became more prone to poverty.},

Bridging implies a crosscutting network with thin trust and is measured as inter-ethnic contacts and outward orientation. It is examined to what extent bonding and bridging for immigrants in the Netherlands can be associated with a higher likelihood of employment and higher income. Results show that (1) bridging networks are positively associated with both employment and income; (2) bonding networks do not affect economic outcomes; and (3) levels of trust (neither thick nor thin) cannot explain economic outcomes.},

For the Turkish migrants, inter-ethnic friendships reduce the duration of unemployment, whereas intra-ethnic friendships do not. In other words, only friendships with German natives facilitate the transition to employment, but in particular for Turkish migrants. This effect is largest for migrants with a low level of education.},

Estimation of a potential rather than an average earnings function increases the explanatory power of the human capital approach and allows for detecting discrimination as well as assimilation processes. The empirical results im-ply that the human capital gap explains more than 75\% of the wage differential between natives and foreign nationalities in Germany. As for ethnic Germans migrants, their wage disparity can be explained by 50\% with human capital differentials. Surprisingly, only small differences could be observed with regard to the question of earnings efficiency. On an average, inhabitants as well as immigrants transformed about 85\% to 90\% of their potential income into actual earnings. The sources for the individually diverging efficiency ratios are not well understood, with discrimination only found for ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe. Somewhat disappointing, the assimilation hypothesis was clearly rejected for all migrants with again the exception being ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe.},

One outcome is `civic integration' policies, according to which the most important mechanisms of integration are language training, employment counselling, and especially the inculcation of liberal-democratic values. Few authors, however, have addressed the fact that these policies are essentially civic nationalist ideology applied to migrants, and represent the most recent chapter in a long-standing debate over the relationship between majorities and minorities that focused on intra-state nationalist conflict during the 1990s. Civic integration policies reflect the self-representation of majorities, and are both politically and ontologically problematic. First, in many cases they seem best understood as a kind of symbolic politics that is more about who gets in than how they are integrated. Second, civic nationalism is based on a theory of nations and nationalism that treats these as solely ideological phenomena, and ignores the social bases of integration. `Shared values' are a product of that process, not a mechanism for its achievement.},

Amongst the general public and politicians, irregular immigration to Europe has been associated with a wide range of fears: that countries are losing control over their borders, that social systems are overstretched by unauthorised use, that indigenous workers are being pushed out of the labour market and that criminality is growing. Strategic borders have been strengthened with guards, watchtowers, fences and state-of-the-art technology \textemdash{} such as infrared scanning devices, motion detectors and video surveillance. However, although irregular migrants are still here and their presence is now a fact of life in all EU member states, according to Morehouse and Blomfield (2011) the annual flow of irregular migration into Europe has decreased since 2002, although this has been masked by localised surges. Nevertheless, current estimates of the size and scope of the population of irregular migrants are characterised as `guesstimates' \textemdash{} numbers which assume a life of their own, and are not relevant to national policy-level decisions regarding migration. The reduction in numbers coincides with an increase in border protection politics and the onset of the economic crisis.},

Mit Bezug auf neuere Forschung zur Heterogenit\"at unternehmerischer Aktivit\"aten fragen wir, inwieweit diese Verortung gerechtfertigt ist, oder ob migrantisches Unternehmertum nicht auch heterogene Binnenstrukturen aufweist. Mit Mikrozensusdaten und unter Einbezug verschiedener Herkunftsgruppen werden zentrale Charakteristika, haupts\"achlich Bildungsstand, wirtschaftssektorale Orientierung und Einkommen, untersucht. Die Befunde widersprechen einem generellen Prekarit\"atsverdacht, verweisen aber auf eine starke Diversit\"at in den Herkunftsgruppen und darauf, dass sich die soziale Position eines gro\ss en Teils migrantischer Selbst\"andigkeit derjenigen der Deutschen n\"ahert. Since 1991 the number of self-employed immigrants in Germany has almost tripled. As far as this trend has been picked up as a topic of social research, immigrant self-employment has mainly been analysed as a form of precarious work. Drawing upon new research on heterogeneity of self-employment, we ask if this description of the phenomenon is adequate. Using data of the German micro census we try to draw a more complete picture. In doing so, we focus on indicators for education, knowledge-intensive businesses services and the income of the self-employed. Results show that seeing immigrant self-employment only as a form of precarious work cannot be justified. Instead, results reveal a great heterogeneity and diversity between immigrant groups. There is also evidence that the social situations of immigrant and of German self-employed are becoming more similar.},

Otto Neurath introduced the term ``Lebenslage'' (conditions of life) as a concept for assessing the life an individual leads. Kurt Grelling has adopted the term but interpreted it in a new way which has been summarized by Gerhard Weisser in the slogan of conditions of life forming the scope for human action. Then the paper gives a short overview of the capability approach of Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum. The life a person leads is described by the capability approach as a ``bundle of functionings'' which she has chosen out of ``capability set''. Martha Nussbaum focuses on identifying ``central functional capabilities''. Those two approaches show some similarities: interpersonal comparability is a common theme in Neurath and Sen; Grelling, Weisser and Sen develop a concept of an opportunity set which indicates the scope for action in leading a life and share the idea of its having an impact on human wellbeing. Therefore the concepts need participation when implemented. As a consequence, poverty measurement based on these approaches has to solve two problems: First, it has to take into accountthe multiplicity of dimensions, and secondly, it has to find a way how to measure opportunity sets empirically.},

  abstract = {Being one of the leading paradigms for analyzing human well-being, the Capability Approach (CA) may serve as a frame of reference for job-satisfaction. The CA mainly argues for (1) complementing information on job-satisfaction by the more objective conception of "valuable work" to avoid biases due to adaptive preferences and (2) taking a holistic perspective of the multidimensional work-situation while (3) emphasizing the importance of opportunities and individual choice and agency. Thereby the CA provides a new perspective on classical insights on job-satisfaction by putting them into a broader framework. This paper is but a first tentative appreciation of the CA in this context.},

Therefore the operationalizability of the CA has been questioned. Despite this, a lot of empirical studies apply the CA in various contexts and on a multitude of issues. This paper discusses the challenges in operationalizing the approach and reports on the methods used to meet them. Special attention is paid to studies of labor-related issues. It turns out that studies of labor-related issues have developed new methods for operationalizing the CA using available data. Generating primary data is another way to meet the challenge of modeling freedom of choice, the core concept of the CA, but has been used less with respect of labor-related issues. After discussing the challenges of operationalizing the CA, the paper briefly addresses the relation between labor and wellbeing in economic theory. Then one section reviews empirical studies based on available data and the methods they use and the next one primary studies of the CA. The last section concludes.},

The concept of precarity is explored as a way of understanding intensifying and insecure post-Fordist work in late capitalism. Migrants are centrally implicated in highly precarious work experiences at the bottom end of labour markets in Global North countries, including becoming trapped in forced labour. Building on existing research on the working experiences of migrants in the Global North, the main part of the article considers three questions. First, what is precarity and how does the concept relate to working lives? Second, how might we understand the causes of extreme forms of migrant labour exploitation in precarious lifeworlds? Third, how can we adequately theorize these particular experiences using the conceptual tools of forced labour, slavery, unfreedom and precarity? We use the concept of `hyper-precarity' alongside notions of a `continuum of unfreedom' as a way of furthering human geographical inquiry into the intersections between various terrains of social action and conceptual debate concerning migrants' precarious working experiences.},

Data on 41,996 children under age 18 from the 1990 Current Population Survey support three general conclusions. First, parental employment and children's poverty are inextricably linked in married-couple and female-headed families. Second, simulations reveal that child poverty rates are nevertheless relatively insensitive to increases in parental employment. Only very large and unrealistic increases in maternal employment would significantly reduce child poverty rates. Third, the large black-white differences in child poverty are not simply a result of racial differences in paternal and maternal employment. The problem is not one of finding a job, but rather a job that pays well enough to lift the family (and its children) out of poverty.},

We find that increasing maternal employment accounted for roughly one-half of the decline in poverty among children living with single mothers. The largest economic benefits from increasing maternal employment were observed among African American children and those living with poorly educated mothers. Unlike the 1991\textendash 1995 period, changes in family structure over 1996\textendash 2000 were no longer giving demographic impetus to higher child poverty rates. Evidence that recent declines in nonmarital fertility have reduced child poverty rates, however, is limited.

This paper reports the results of a research project undertaken in 2007 that sought to reduce and refine a longer survey in order to provide a summary measure of wellbeing and capability in the realm of public health. The reduction and refinement of the questionnaire took place across a number of stages, using both qualitative (five focus group discussions and 17 in-depth interviews) and quantitative (secondary data analysis, N~=~1048 and primary data collection using postal surveys and interviews, N~=~45) approaches. The questionnaire was reduced from its original 60+~questions to 24 questions (including demographic questions). Each of Nussbaum's ten Central Human Capabilities are measured using one (or more) of the 18 specific capability items which are included in the questionnaire (referred to as the OCAP-18). Analysis of the questionnaire responses (N~=~198) found that respondents differed with respect to the levels of capabilities they reported, and that these capabilities appear to be sensitive to one's gender, age, income and deprivation decile. An index of capability, estimated by assuming equal weight for each capability question, found that the average level of capability amongst respondents was 12.44 (range 3\textendash 17.75). This index was found to be highly correlated with a measure of health (EQ-5D) and wellbeing (global QoL), although some differences were apparent. This project operationalised the capability approach to produce an instrument to measure the effectiveness (and cost effectiveness) of public health interventions; the resulting OCAP-18 appears to be responsive and measure something supplementary to health and wellbeing, thus offers a promising addition to the current suite of outcome measures that are available.},

The predictions of our model thus differ from those of divorce threat bargaining models; in the separate spheres model, cash transfer payments to the mother and payments to the father can--but need not--imply different equilibrium distributions in existing marriages. In the long run, the distributional effects of transfer policies may be substantially altered by changes in the marriage market equilibrium.},

Several factors contribute to a concern about work-family simultaneity. First, married men behave very differently from single men, and fathers from non-fathers. Second, transitions into and out of marriage, cohabitation, and custodial parenthood respond to current economic conditions, and not just to fixed individual characteristics. Finally, demographic changes in developed countries have left marriage and parenthood optional, economically ambiguous, and relatively unstable. Labor economists need to recognize that a man's current partnership and parenting status are current choices that can change, that are expected to change, and that respond to the social, economic, and institutional forces that also condition labor market behavior.},

Since the seminal work of Townsend (1979), it has been recognized that other aspects of life not necessarily related to income can impair human development, such as the access to public goods, health, or education. Many authors have come up with new approaches to provide poverty measures which account for its multidimensionality while maintaining desirable properties (Bourguignon and Chakravarty, 1999, 2003; Atkinson, 2003). One main conceptual issue is how to count multidimensional poverty. In other words, is multidimensional poverty the accumulation of deprivation in various components of what is considered `normal life' (the intersection approach) or should it be defined as the failure to access to at least one of the dimensions (the union approach)?},

Some degree of robustness may be sought through weak uniform rankings of states, as by stochastic dominance and related criteria. A useful starting point, both for the believers and non-believers in the multidimensional approach, is to see the traditional univariate assessments in the multiattribute setting: it is as though a weight of one is attached to a single attribute, typically income or consumption, and zero weights given to all other real and potential factors! Univariate approaches do not avoid, they rather impose very strong a priori values.},

The former fails to offer opportunities to women to safely embark on autonomous migratory projects, the latter contributes to reproduce traditional gender biases in the countries of origin as well as of destination.

Several European governments have adopted policies to geographically disperse refugees. While many theoretical arguments and descriptive studies analyze the impact of spatially concentrated ethnic networks on immigrant integration, there is limited causal evidence that sheds light on the efficacy of these policies. We provide evidence by studying the economic integration of refugees in Switzerland, where some refugees are assigned to live in a specific location upon arrival and, by law, are not permitted to relocate during the first 5 y. Leveraging this exogenous placement mechanism, we find that refugees assigned to locations with many conationals are more likely to enter the labor market. This benefit is most pronounced about 3 y after arrival and weakens somewhat with longer residency. In addition, we find that, among refugees employed by the same company, a high proportion share nationality, ethnicity, or language, which suggests that ethnic residential networks transmit information about employment opportunities. Together, these findings contribute to our understanding of the importance of ethnic networks for facilitating refugee integration, and they have implications for the design of refugee allocation policies.},

The present paper uses this new indicator as a springboard for a discussion of the potential of a multidimensional measure, based on these three domains, to analyse the risk of poverty and social exclusion among immigrants. It is argued that the analytical insight and internal consistency of the new Europe 2020 indicator can be enhanced by a more structured measurement approach, relying on some recent advances generated by multidimensional poverty literature. The Alkire-Foster methodology provides a natural extension to the Europe 2020 indicator, which can usefully complement the picture drawn from the at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion statistics. In the second part of the paper, these adjusted measures are used to analyse the multidimensional poverty profiles of immigrant households in Spain and other five developed countries, as well as the changes occurring since the beginning of the economic downturn. We try to show that the Europe 2020 indicator alone may not be sufficient to reflect the growing intensity of multidimensional deprivation among immigrants in some countries.},

Using long-running panel data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey we examine trends in multidimensional poverty in Australia between 2001 and 2013. We find that this has been relatively stable, with some evidence of an upwards trend following from the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. However, a closer examination of the individual components reveals a more dynamic picture. Deprivation concerning health, material resources, social support and education increased over the 13-year observation period, offsetting decreases in deprivation concerning safety perceptions, employment and community participation. Additionally, using counterfactual simulations, we examine the relative roles of different poverty domains in explaining changes in Australian multidimensional poverty. We find that recent year-on-year changes in multidimensional poverty are mainly driven by fluctuations in social support, health and material resources. Altogether, our findings suggest that Australian poverty-reduction policies would enhance their effectiveness and efficiency by focusing on improving disadvantage in the domains of health and material resources.},

We find that immigrant households have multidimensional poverty levels that are clearly higher than those of the native-born population, irrespective of the specific threshold used. The size of the gap varies significantly across countries, with France, Italy and Spain performing much worse than Germany and the UK. The differences are especially large in the case of children of migrant background in countries like Italy or Spain, a result which suggests the need of better targeting this group in the new Southern European immigration countries. The paper also shows that there are some cross-country differences in the pattern of overlap between dimensions, thus confirming the importance of country-level determinants in shaping multidimensional poverty among native and immigrant households.},

We find that, on average, visa-free mobility has increased over the past 40 years. However, not everybody has benefited from these developments. In fact, visa waivers are increasingly unequally divided: while citizens of OECD countries and rich countries have gained mobility rights, mobility rights for other regions have stagnated or even diminished, in particular for citizens from African countries. Overall, we find a clear bifurcation in mobility rights, leading to a `global mobility divide'.},

These ``new fathers'' are expected to be more equal partners in parenting, nurturing children, and performing both interactive and physical caregiving. However, the roles of provider and involved father may conflict: Whereas the ``new father'' role requires spending time with children, the ``provider'' role requires commitment to spending time on the job. Using two waves of the Child Development Supplement to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (N = 1,139), this study examines the relationship between employment and father involvement and whether fathering attitudes moderate that relationship. Results suggest work hours are not strongly related to father involvement. Despite generally long work hours, a subgroup of ``new fathers'' appear better able to preserve time with children, likely by cutting back on, or incorporating their children into, their leisure time.},

This article examines how events\textemdash such as changes in household composition, employment status, disability status, and economic conditions\textemdash affect poverty entries and exits.

The analysis uses discrete-time multivariate hazard models along with monthly, longitudinal data from the 1988, 1990, and 1996 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Results. Analyses show that many events are related to the likelihood of entering and exiting poverty. Of the trigger events examined, individuals living in households that experience a loss or gain of employment are the most likely to enter and exit poverty. We also find that changes in employment are more important in the 1996 to 1999 time period\textemdash after welfare reform\textemdash than in the 1988 to 1992 time period\textemdash prior to welfare reform. Finally, changes in household composition, disability status, and educational attainment are found to play a role in throwing people into poverty and helping them exit from poverty in both time periods. Conclusions. There is no single path into or out of poverty, suggesting that multiple policies can be considered to help alleviate poverty.},

Four hypotheses regarding the effect of a father's absence are tested: the "no-effects" hypothesis, the "economic-deprivation" hypothesis, the "father-absence" hypothesis, and the "family-stress" hypothesis. Separate analyses are presented for black and whites. The findings indicate that growing up in a female-headed family increases the risk of poverty, but not because of father absence per se. Among whites, economic deprivation and the stress associated with recent family disruption account for nearly all the negative effects of family structure on offsprings' attainment, whereas among black the results are more mixed.},

In the light of these analyses, the aptness of Preference Theory (Hakim 2000) as an explanation for the position of women in the British labour market is considered. Addressed in particular is Hakim's argument (2000: 7) that the main determinant of women's heterogeneous employment patterns and work histories is heterogeneity in their preferences for differing combinations of family work and paid employment. Although support is found for Hakim's argument that employment careers are centrally important for only a minority of women, little evidence is adduced that it is preferences that distinguish the minority from the majority. The existence of a continuum of work\textendash family preferences means that women with similar preferences (but differing capacities for overcoming constraints) will have very different labour market careers. Analysis of longitudinal data fails to support the central argument of Preference Theory that women in Britain and North America (countries where women live `in the new scenario') have genuine, unconstrained choices about how they wish to live their lives. Instead, it is argued that a complete explanation of women's labour market choices after childbirth, and of the outcomes of those choices, depends as much on understanding the constraints that differentially affect women as it does on understanding their personal preferences.},

We show that, in comparison to the non-immigrant population in Germany, marriage at a relatively young age can be traced back particularly to the absence of pre-marital cohabitation. Among immigrants, there appears to be a preference for a partner of the same religion, and, as usual among non-migrants, people with an academic or professional degree largely prefer partners who have an equivalent level of education.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the effect of native/immigrant intermarriage on divorce. We used a rich longitudinal dataset from the German Socio-Economic Panel and applied event-history techniques to examine the risk of divorce among immigrants in Germany. Our analysis of the divorce rates of 5,648 marriages shows that immigrant couples have  a lower risk of divorce than do natives. However, marriages between German-born individuals and immigrants have a higher likelihood of separation than marriages between two German-born individuals or between immigrants from the same country, supporting the exogamy hypothesis. This pattern largely persists when controlling for the socio-demographic and human-capital characteristics of the spouses. The divorce risk increases with the cultural distance between the partners and when the spouses demonstrate differences in their social backgrounds, also supporting the heterogamyhypothesis and the selectivity hypothesis. We found no support for the adaptation and convergence hypotheses. Divorce levels for mixed marriages are neither similar to the levels of one of the constituent origin groups, nor do they fall between the levels of the two groups; the divorce levels for native/immigrant marriages are higher than those for endogamous marriages.},

  abstract = {A recent edition of this Journal (Volume 16, Part 2, April 1987) was devoted to a number of articles on the definition and measurement of poverty. Surprisingly, perhaps, this did not include any specific discussion of gender differences in the causes, extent and experience of poverty. But such gender differences do exist, though they are often obscured by much research on poverty. Our initial response to the special edition on poverty was to write a reply discussing how the various contributors had ignored the issue of gender. But women cannot simply be `added in' to existing analyses; instead a different analytic framework is required. This article therefore begins by looking at some of the widespread evidence of the economic disadvantage of women compared with men. We then go on to discuss why it is necessary to focus on the gender dimensions of poverty. We argue that this involves far more than simply disaggregating data to produce statistics about the situation of women. Rather, this focus leads us to explore the structural causes of women's poverty and the gendered processes in the labour market, welfare systems and domestic household which interact to create and maintain that disadvantage. In the final section we consider some of the important conceptual and methodological issues which must be tackled if we are to find ways to investigate and measure poverty which are not gender-blind.},

We find significant effects of family allowances, generous parental leaves and childcare provisions, with more powerful effects for single mothers.

Eastern Europeans were now not only `free to leave' to the West but more exactly `free to leave and to come back'. In this text I will focus on gendered transnational, cross-border practices and capabilities of Central and Eastern Europeans on the move, who use their spatial mobility to adapt to the new context of post-communist transition. We are dealing here with practices that are very different from those which the literature on `immigrant transnationalism' is mostly about. Rather than relying on transnational networking for improving their condition in the country of their settlement, they tend to `settle within mobility,' staying mobile `as long as they can' in order to improve or maintain the quality of life at home. Their experience of migration thus becomes their lifestyle, their leaving home and going away, paradoxically, a strategy of staying at home, and, thus, an alternative to what migration is usually considered to be \textemdash{} emigration/immigration. Access to and management of mobility is gendered and dependent on institutional context. Mobility as a strategy can be empowering, a resource, a tool for social innovation and agency and an important dimension of social capital \textemdash{} if under the migrants' own control. However, mobility may reflect increased dependencies, proliferation of precarious jobs and, as in the case of trafficking in women, lack of mobility and freedom.},

In illustrating its application, the study shows how such an approach goes beyond a traditional citizenship framework (e.g., Marshall, 1950) in considering degrees of partial membership, but remains cautious with respect to claims about universal, transnational rights.},

In general, our results reinforce findings from previous studies by showing that migration contributes to labor force nonparticipation and unemployment among married women. Migration also is linked to other forms of labor force hardship, including involuntary part-time employment and low pay. Contrary to expectations, migration also negatively affects employment adequacy among single women. The implications of these results for family decision-making models of migration are discussed.},

Capabilities are in Sen's vocabulary therefore the real freedoms people have or the opportunities available to them. In this paper we examine the impact of capabilities alongside choices on well-being. There is a lot of theoretical work on Sen's capability framework but still a lack of empirical research in measuring and testing his capability model especially in a dynamic perspective. The contribution of the paper is first to test Sen's theoretical CA approach empirically using 25 years of German and 18 years of British data. Second, to examine to what extent the capability approach can explain long-term changes in well-being and third to view the impact on subjective as well as objective well-being in two clearly distinct welfare states. Three measures of well-being are constructed: life satisfaction for subjective well-being and relative income and employment security for objective well-being. We ran random and fixed effects GLS models. The findings strongly support Sen's capabilities framework and provide evidence on the way capabilities, choices and constraints matter for objective and subjective well-being. Capabilities pertaining to human capital, trust, altruism and risk taking, and choices to family, work-leisure, lifestyle and social behaviour show to strongly affect long-term changes in subjective and objective well-being though in a different way largely depending on the type of well-being measure used.},

Counterfactual decompositions of wage differentials allow us to identify and quantify their drivers, thus explaining within a common framework what is often labelled the unexplained wage gap.},

Further, feminist scholars commonly consider the effects of gender as it intersects with race or class, but relatively little of this research has included nativity (being either an immigrant or native-born to a society). This article addresses these shortcomings by examining patterns of earnings inequality at the intersection of gender, race, and nativity, comparing cohorts of African-born Black and white immigrants to their US-born counterparts over multiple time-points. Further, the depressive effects of gender are large enough so that while there are differences in women's earnings across race and nativity, nearly all groups of men still earn more than nearly all groups of women. The article's results demonstrate that privilege has a magnifying effect, with the advantages conferred from one privileged status increasing the effects of other privilege statuses, which become larger over time. These findings contribute to how feminists understand privileges and oppressions emerging from the intersections of gender with other social statuses, and how such intersections shape economic inequality.},

These data are particularly valuable because they permit the identification of first-, second- and third- or higher- generation individuals, thereby providing a clearer picture of the process of assimilation. We focus upon the achievements of men, age 20 to 64, classified simultaneously by nativity and ethnicity. Not surprisingly, there are notable differences in the occupational attainment of foreign- born men. Some of these differences are due to the diverse social and economic backgrounds of the different nationalities, but important differences in the rates of return to background characteristics are also evident. The assimilation perspective predicts that eventually ethnic background will no longer be an important determinant of socioeconomic achievement. By the third generation, we find this to be true for the most part, although important exceptions are discussed in this paper.},

  abstract = {In recent years, several European countries have adopted mandatory language and civic education requirements for immigrants. This dissertation examines why and to what effect this particular integration policy has spread across large parts of Europe. To do so, it is divided into three empirical chapters. The first chapter addresses the question why European countries have adopted mandatory language and civic education requirements for immigrants at different times and to different extents. To answer this question, I analyze country-level data on 25 EU member states between 2005 and 2014. I find that a country's integration policy is strongly influenced by its past policy as well as the policies of the countries most successful at integrating their immigrant communities. In addition, I find that immigrants' level of economic integration is positively related to the strictness of a country's integration requirements; models with endogeneity correction suggest that the causal arrow runs exclusively from the latter to the former. The second empirical chapter evaluates whether mandatory language and civic education requirements for immigrants have been successful at achieving their intended goals. It uses data provided by the European Social Survey (2002-2015) to examine the effect of different integration policies in 15 EU member states on immigrants' levels of social, political, and economic integration. I find that mandatory integration requirements have a strong and positive effect on immigrants' level of economic integration, but no impact on their degree of social and political integration. In the final chapter, I posit that integration policies not only affect the immigrants targeted by them but also have broader impacts on the host society. Specifically, I argue that public opinion toward immigrants is more favorable in countries with mandatory language and civic education requirements for immigrants than it is in countries without. Analyzing public opinion data in 15 EU member states provided by the European Social Survey (2002-2015) as well as evidence from two original survey experiments in the United Kingdom, I find support for my argument. Therefore, the results presented in this dissertation make a reasonable case for the adoption of stricter language and civic education requirements for immigrants.},

If immigrant women are segregated in occupations with few native women, it is important to take this into account to analyse wage differentials between both collectives. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} Microdata from the Continuous Sample of Working Histories (Muestra Continua de Vidas Laborales) on wages and other personal characteristics such as gender, country of origin, and age were used to apply the matching procedure and the decomposition of the wage gap, along the lines of \~Nopo, for the analysis of wage differentials between native and immigrant women. The advantage of this procedure is that one can simultaneously estimate the common support and the mean counterfactual wage for the women on the common support (i.e. comparing native and immigrant women with similar observable characteristics). In addition, differences not only at the mean but also along the entire wage distribution can be described. Findings \textendash{} The results obtained indicate that, on average, immigrant women earn less than native women in the Spanish labour market. This wage gap is bigger when immigrant women from developing countries are considered, but the authors' main finding is that an important part of this wage gap is related to differences in common support (i.e. immigrant women are segregated in certain jobs with low wages different from those occupied by native women). If the need to control for common support is neglected, estimates of the wage gap will be biased. Originality/value \textendash{} Studying the case of Spain is particularly interesting because it is a country with abundant and recent immigration. Immigrant women account for more than half of the total immigrants in Spain, and unlike other host countries, they come from a highly varied range of countries, with origins as diverse as Latin America, the Maghreb and Eastern Europe. To the authors' knowledge, no other study has explicitly focused on the analysis of the wage differential of immigrant women in the Spanish labour market by taking into account the need to control for common support. Moreover, published papers illustrating the potentiality of \~Nopo's methodology are also very scarce.},

We use data from the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) on 1,148,762 coupled households, covering 18 OECD countries and the period from 1973 to 2013. In this period, women's share of household earnings grew, spouses' earnings became more strongly and positively correlated in various countries, and inequality in women's earnings was reduced. Inequality in household earnings increased due to the rising correlation between spouses' earnings, but was reduced more by the decline of inequality in women's earnings. Had women's earnings remained unchanged since the 1970s and 1980s, inequality in household earnings would have been higher around 2010 in all observed OECD countries. Household inequality was reduced least by trends in women's earnings in countries with a long history of high female labor-force participation, such as Finland (3\% reduction) and Sweden (5\%), and most in countries that observed a stronger increase in female labor-force participation in recent decades such as Spain (31\%) and the Netherlands (41\%). As more countries are reaching a plateau in the growth of women's employment and earnings, the potential for further stimulating women's employment and earnings to counter both women's and household inequality seems to be increasingly limited.},

This study presents novel estimates of the association between macro-level trends in women's employment and trends in poverty, across 15 OECD countries from 1971 to 2013. It does so based on over 2 million household-level observations from the LIS Database, using Kitagawa\textendash Blinder\textendash Oaxaca (KBO) decompositions. The results indicate that an increase of 10\% points in women's employment rate was associated with a reduction of about 1\% point of poverty across these countries. In part, this reduction compensated for developments in men's employment that were associated with higher poverty. However, in the Nordic countries no such poverty association was found, as in these countries women's employment rates were very high and stable throughout the observation period. In countries that initially showed marked increases in women's employment, such as the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Canada, and the United States, the initial increases in women's employment rates were typically followed by a period in which these trends levelled off. Hence, our findings first and foremost suggest that improving gender equality in employment is associated with lower poverty risks. Yet, the results also suggest that the potential of following an employment strategy to (further) reduce poverty in OECD countries has, to a large extent, been depleted.},

It first investigates the most satisfactory dimensional structure for the analysis of material derivation \textemdash{} that is, a grouping of items into different sets that reflect distinct aspects of living standards and deprivation, such as the capacity to afford basic requirements, the possession of consumer durables, housing conditions, and the quality of neighbourhood environment. It assesses the levels of reliability associated with the dimensions proposed, and discusses how dimensional structure and indices relate to those advanced in other EU-level studies on this topic. It then documents the variation across countries in terms of the deprivation dimensions identified, taking into account alternative ways of assigning importance or weight to different items. It examines the relationship between different dimensions of deprivation, income, and social class, arguing that the particular form of deprivation called `consumption deprivation' is most suitable if one is seeking to capture generalized deprivation. Finally, the chapter looks at the extent to which different dimensions of deprivation are correlated with each other and how frequently they are to be found together in households experiencing multiple deprivation.},

In reviewing the research literature, it describes the types of indicators employed and their key characteristics, and brings out the various approaches that have been adopted in using them to capture poverty and social exclusion. The specific indicators available in the two core comparative datasets providing such information for EU countries, namely the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) and the more recent European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC), are described in some detail. It also discuss the types of conceptual framework into which such analysis can be set, and identifies the key challenges in developing empirical methods that are both more firmly rooted conceptually and succeed in identifying the individuals and households of most interest from a policy-making perspective.},

  abstract = {Research on poverty in rich countries relies primarily on household income to capture living standards and distinguish those in poverty, and this is also true of official poverty measurement and monitoring. However, awareness of the limitations of income has been heightening interest in the role that non-monetary measures of deprivation can play. This book takes as its starting-point that research on poverty and social exclusion has been undergoing a fundamental shift towards a multidimensional approach; that researchers and policy-makers alike have struggled to develop concepts and indicators that do this approach justice; and that this is highly salient not only within individual countries (including both Britain and the USA) but also for the European Union post-enlargement. The difficulties encountered in applying a multidimensional approach reflect limitations in the information available but also in the conceptual and empirical underpinnings provided by existing research. The central aim of this book is to contribute to the development of those underpinnings and to productive ways of employing non-monetary indicators of deprivation. It will appeal to readers from diverse disciplinary perspectives, especially those concerned with substantive issues and policy implications. In addressing this audience it also provides a non-technical account of recent developments in the rapidly expanding academic literature, serving as a guide to those who wish to explore it in greater depth. The book maps out the current landscape and the best way forward, concluding by offering a critical evaluation of the EU's 2020 poverty reduction target.},

It begins with a discussion of the reasons why one might expect a household's current equivalized income to have difficulties in fully capturing its command over financial resources in relation to its needs, and thus anticipate a priori that relying simply on income to measure poverty could be problematic. It then investigates the extent of overlap or mismatch between being below a relative income poverty threshold and above a corresponding consumption-related deprivation threshold, for twenty-six European countries. It looks at the cross-classification of persons by these income poverty and deprivation standards, distinguishing those who are both income poor and deprived, income poor but not deprived, deprived but not income poor, and neither income poor or deprived. Finally, the chapter turns from a static cross-sectional perspective to an analysis of the persistence of income poverty and deprivation over time, using the longitudinal data from the European Community Household Panel.},

The development of poverty and social exclusion monitoring in the EU must be seen in the light of the evolution of the broader EU social policy context. In deciding in 2000 that social policy should be a distinct focus of attention for EU cooperation, the European Council also agreed on the process by which this should be implemented. This was to be done through the open method of coordination (OMC) with key elements being the agreement of common objectives in relation to poverty and social exclusion and the adoption of common indicators to monitor progress. In this chapter, we wish to stress that the choices we make in relation to the conceptualisation and measurement of poverty and social exclusion have important implications in relation to our ability to formulate and address policy issues. In particular, they affect what we consider to be a crucial ability to address national and EU issues in relation to poverty and inequality and the manner in which they are related and our capacity to illuminate the underlying processes.},

Two of these are analogous to the elements of the BO decomposition (but computed only over the common support of the distributions of characteristics), while the other two account for differences in the supports.},

The answer not only has important political implications; it also helps us understand the extent to which basic cultural values are enduring or malleable, and whether cultural values are traits of individuals or are attributes of a given society. The first part of this article considers theories about the impact of growing social diversity in Western nations. We classify two categories of society: Origins (defined as Islamic Countries of Origin for Muslim migrants, including twenty nations with plurality Muslim populations) and Destinations (defined as Western Countries of Destination for Muslim migrants, including 22 OECD member states with Protestant or Roman Catholic majority populations). Using this framework, we demonstrate that, on average, the basic social values of Muslim migrants fall roughly midway between those prevailing in their country of origin and their country of destination. We conclude that Muslim migrants do not move to Western countries with rigidly fixed attitudes; instead, they gradually absorb much of the host culture, as assimilation theories suggest.},

This paper studies headcounts (counting deprived individuals) and adjusted headcounts (counting deprivations of deprived individuals) while the cumulative threshold can be distribution dependent (relative) or not (absolute). The measures are empirically tested on the 2007 EU-SILC data for the United Kingdom, Germany, France and the Netherlands. The findings indicate that the absolute adjusted headcount with a cumulative threshold of one deprivation is the most attractive candidate: it has an intuitive interpretation; it is sensitive to the breadth of deprivations but not oversensitive to changes in the methodology.},

Intermarried couples may specialize less due to smaller comparative advantages resulting from positive assortative mating by education, and due to different bargaining positions within the household. The empirical analysis relies on panel data using a two limit Random Effects Tobit framework to identify determinants of a gender-neutral specialization index. Results indicate that for immigrants intermarriage is indeed related to less specialization, as is similar education levels of spouses, while children and being Muslim or Islamic are associated with greater specialization. For natives, on the other hand, the likelihood to specialize increases with intermarriage. This might result from differences in bargaining strength or be due to adaptation to immigrants' gender roles.},

The list of Central Human Capabilities that forms the core of my political project contains many functions that many people over the ages have preferred not to grant to women, either not at all, or not on a basis of equality. To insist on their centrality is thus to go against preferences that have considerable depth and breadth in traditions of male power. Moreover, the list contains many items that women over the ages have not wanted for themselves, and some that even today many women do not pursue \textendash{} so in putting the list at the center of a normative political project aimed at providing the philosophical underpinning for basic political principles, we are going against not just other people's preferences about women, but, more controversially, against many preferences (or so it seems) of women about themselves and their lives. To some extent, my approach, like Sen's, avoids these problems of paternalism by insisting that the political goal is capability, not actual functioning, and by dwelling on the central importance of choice as a good. But the notion of choice and practical reason used in the list is a normative notion, emphasizing the critical activity of reason in a way that does not reflect the actual use of reason in many lives.},

Rather than focusing on the appearance of the demand for migrant labour in social reproduction work, we analyse the situation of both men and women in highly feminised and masculinised activities by studying the impact each exerts on the other, and the way in which this conditions the gender breakdown of the migrant population. We provide a historical view of the work of migrants in the care and cleaning sectors, comparing it with male migrant employment\textemdash mostly in construction\textemdash and analysing the gendered breakdown of migrant communities. We argue that, in contrast to the generally accepted discourse on the international scene, there has not been a steady evolution in the feminisation of migrant labour in Spain and Portugal. Instead, the presence of migrant women on the labour market fluctuates in accordance with a specific set of variables: welfare state and care regimes, immigration policies, historical links influencing the national origin of migrants, the housing situation, labour markets and the respective economic situations in the construction industry and in domestic and care work.},

It first outlines basic concepts and typologies related to sending country policies, focusing particularly on key countries of origin of migrants settled within the European Union. Second, the chapter reviews central explanations for the emergence of sending country policies. However, sending countries do not reach out to their emigrants in equal measure. Differences are therefore examined in the outreach policies of sending countries and in sending countries' transnational relations with diasporas. The last part of the chapter discusses the nexus between sending country policies and migrant integration in the country of residence. On the basis of existing research, the chapter argues that sending country policies may intersect with migrants' integration in a number of ways. For example, migrant sending countries may seek to strengthen the upward mobility of their expatriate citizens in their place of residence abroad, and they may call for greater protection of migrant workers in precarious labour situations. Little is currently known about how migrants and diasporas respond to these policies and how they are perceived by political actors of countries of residence. This is an area for further study. More analysis is also needed to determine the extent that sending country outreach policies aimed at bonding with and supporting citizens abroad challenge territorial policy sovereignty and the strength of receiving countries in agenda-setting in international cooperation on migration and migrant settlement.},

While gender-based persecution laws and policies offer optimism for women fleeing gendered harm, the implementation of these laws and policies may reproduce victimization for migrant women. A study of the implementation of gender-based persecution laws and policies makes visible assumptions about masculinity, femininity, sexuality, essentialism, women's agency, and authority that asylum seekers, immigration attorneys, service providers, immigration judges, and asylum officers engage.

Concentrating on the household type which is composed of a married couple and their dependent children, the article outlines three broad types of allocation system \textendash{} the whole wage system, the allowance system and the pooling system. It is suggested that there are links between the system of allocation within the family, the stage in the life cycle which the family has reached, the income level of the household, and the occupational, regional and ethnic culture within which the household is located. The article concludes by suggesting that a better knowledge of intra-household money flows would be relevant to discussion concerned with the distribution of poverty, the allocation of welfare benefits, and the contribution made by married women's earnings to family living standards, and that it would also contribute to a better understanding of marital tension and marital breakdown.},

Six systems are identified, using categories developed for the Social Change and Economic Life Initiative. Male-managed systems were associated with higher income levels and with male privilege in terms of decision-making and personal spending money. Female-managed systems were associated with lower income levels and with greater financial deprivation for wives. Equality between husband and wife was greatest where money was pooled and managed jointly, but these constituted only one fifth of all households.},

It is suggested that, though a couple's decision to keep their money separate may be motivated by a desire for equality and autonomy, the effect in some households may be to create inequality between the partners. The use of credit cards, which are essentially an individualised form of money, can privilege those with good credit ratings and disadvantage those who have less access to new forms of money. Finally, a wider view of the topic is explored, using evidence on the intra-household economy, on spending patterns and access to credit in sub-Saharan Africa, a part of the world with a long tradition of `separate pots' for married couples. The article concludes that many of the issues in sub-Saharan Africa also apply in the `developed' world.},

The second generation of post-1965 immigrants came of age during this ``gender revolution.'' However, assimilation theories focus mainly on racial/ethnic trajectories. Do gendered trajectories between and within groups better capture mobility patterns? Using the 1980 decennial census and the 2003\textendash 2007 Current Population Survey (CPS), we observe the socioeconomic status of Latino and Asian immigrant parents and their second-generation children 25 years later. We compare the educational, occupational, and earnings attainment of second-generation daughters and sons with that of their immigrant mothers and fathers. We simultaneously compare those socioeconomic trajectories with a U.S.-born white, non-Latino reference group. We find that second-generation women experience greater status attainment than both their mothers and their male counterparts, but the earnings of second-generation women lag behind those of men. However, because white mainstream women experienced similar intergenerational mobility, many gaps between the second generation and the mainstream remain. These patterns remain even after we control for parenthood status. With feminized intergenerational mobility occurring similarly across race, the racial/ethnic gaps observed in 1980 narrow but persist into the next generation for many outcomes. Both gender and race shape mobility trajectories, so ignoring either leads to an incomplete picture of assimilation.},

  abstract = {In the last three decades, Portugal has undergone deep changes regarding international migration. Firstly, it has become an important receiver of foreign international migrants from Africa, namely the ones coming from the ex-colonies, now independent countries. Secondly, it witnessed a growing presence of Brazilians, which turned from a narrow middle-high class group of immigrants, to a very large number of middle-low and low class immigrants. Thirdly, it observed a progressive diversification of national origins, mainly represented by the recent and vast Eastern European community, but also visible in dozens of other growing foreign nationalities. In this paper, the focus will be on the role played by labour markets in the growth of new migrations, particularly in what is linked to the importance of smuggling and gender segmentation. Regarding smuggling, the strong recent expansion of the Portuguese economy, accompanied by frequent informal relationships in the labour market, largely explain the surge in the number of immigrants. These migrants often entered the country in an irregular way, using the services of smugglers and traffickers, and performing the bottom jobs of the professional ladder. Given the demand for a flexible labour force and the government's restrictive immigration policy, the objective needs of the labour market were often met by irregular channels of migration. Gender was also a part of the process, since the segmentation of the labour market was increasingly based on ethnic and gender lines. The growth of female related jobs, from domestic and industrial cleaning to caring, and including the sex industry, explained why gendered avenues were built for labour immigration. Although most of the recent labour cycles were dominated by male workers, an increasing fraction was composed of women. Except for the case of trafficking, where exploitation is persistent, women may have acquired in this immigration process an increased but problematic autonomy.},

  abstract = {This chapter expands on recent approaches to the concept of integration. It defines integration in an open non-normative fashion as ``the process of becoming an accepted part of society''. For the study of integration processes and policies a heuristic model is presented encompassing three analytically distinct dimensions in which people may (or may not) become an accepted part of society: (i) the legal-political, (ii) the socio-economic, and (iii) the cultural-religious. Each dimension involves different parties (the immigrants themselves and the receiving society), different levels of analysis (the individual, collective, and institutional levels), and other relevant factors such as time and generations. For the study of integration policies, policy frames, concrete policy measures, and both the vertical and horizontal aspects of integration policymaking are considered in order to account for the complex, multi-layered, and often contradictory character of integration policies. Use of the heuristic device enables integration processes and policies to be systematically described. However, comparison is key when the aim is to explain differences (and similarities) in integration outcomes. The conclusion returns to the concepts of integration and integration policies and suggests avenues for further research.},

  abstract = {To study the development of wage inequality is important for the economic performance as well as for the development of employment. First, I estimate the remuneration to personal characteristics for Germans and immigrants across the wage distribution using quantile regression. My database is the German socio-economic panel for the period 1984-2006. I find a higher inequality between skill groups for Germans relative to immigrants. The returns to skill for the highest educational attainment are higher for Germans across the wage distribution compared to immigrants. But within-group inequality for the group with the highest educational attainment is higher for immigrants. Both groups have concave experience-earnings profiles. One more year of work experience increases the wage more for Germans. Secondly I use the decomposition method of Melly (2006). Decomposition methods are suitable to get further insights into the question as to whether or not the observable differences in the distribution are caused by the difference in the composition or differences in the estimated coefficients. Immigrants have a negative wage gap relative to Germans. The wage gap rises across the distribution and is due to a rising discrimination of immigrants across the wage distribution for the years 1992 and 2006. For the year 1984 the characteristic effect is responsible for the wage gap. Inequality rises for both groups between the year 1992 and 2006. The increase is much stronger for Immigrants. The coefficient effect is mainly responsible for the wage increase across time for both groups.},

Results from the author's own international comparative study of the historical development of the family and the economic integration of women have shown that this was decidedly not the case even for western Europe. Hence the question arises: why is there such historical variation in the development and importance of the housewife model of the male breadwinner family? In the article, an explanation is presented. It is argued that the historical development of the urban bourgeoisie was especially significant for the historical destiny of this cultural model: the social and political strength of the urban bourgeoisie had central societal importance in the imposition of the housewife model of the male breadwinner family as the dominant family form in a given society. In this, it is necessary to distinguish between the imposition of the breadwinner marriage at the cultural level on the one hand, and at the level of social practice in the family on the other.},

It argues that not only differences in welfare-state family policies, but also differences in the gender culture contribute to the explanation of such differences. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} The paper outlines the theoretical approach of the ``gender arrangement'' which conceptualizes the ways in which family policies and culture interact, together with social and economic factors, in their impact on gendered social practices. It then analyses the differences in the employment rates of women with children under age three in six European countries, and how these are influenced by family policies, the gender culture and the labour-market situation in the specific country, using data from international surveys as well as country case studies from an international EU-Project. Findings \textendash{} The findings show that differences in family policies alone do not explain cross-national differences in the employment rates of mothers with children below age three. They support the argument that an explanation requires consideration of a more complex framework of factors, to which culture certainly contributes substantially. Originality/value \textendash{} The role that culture may have in the explanation of the employment of mothers with children in contrast to the role of family policies is still a contested issue. Empirical studies which support the assumption that culture matters in this explanation are still rare. This relates particularly also to the employment of women with children below age three. In this group, cross-national differences in these women's employment rates are particularly high. The paper introduces theoretical and methodological elaborations in this regard.},

This paper contributes by conducting empirical tests of the impact of social/institutional factors on behavior within marriage.

Within a single country, there is limited variation in the social/institutional factors which might affect bargaining power, but across countries identifying variation can be found. Thus, we use a micro-data set constructed using seven countries from the Luxembourg Income Study database in order to estimate a probit model of the labor-force participation of married women.

Drawing on a rich data source for the UK, this paper addresses the question of whether minority ethnic groups in Britain show identity assimilation in the second generation. It concludes that both public and private forms of identification with the majority increase across generations, and minority identities tend to become less salient. This is true across ethnic groups, although there are differences in underlying levels and patterns of identity, reflecting variation in contexts of reception and migration.},

Moreover, this paper shows that becoming unemployed hinders the fulfillment of psychosocial needs that are typically associated with employment, such as social status and higher self-efficacy. The effects of job loss are long-lasting, grow more profound the longer the duration of unemployment and persist following reemployment. Looking at effect heterogeneity, I find that having a partner and being highly educated reduces the negative effects of job loss.},

This study introduces a new method to overcome endogeneity problems in the estimation of cultural effects by using migrant populations. This innovative method uses imputed traits, generated from non-migrating equivalents observed at the country of origin, as instruments for immigrants' own cultural traits measured at the country of destination. By construction, imputed traits are exogenous to immigrants' host social environment. The predicted power of imputed traits over observed traits in instrumental-variable estimation captures the non-idiosyncratic component of preferences and beliefs that migrants and non-migrating equivalents share as members of the same national-origin group, that is, their culture. I use this innovative method to estimate the net exogenous impact of traditional values on female labor-force participation in Europe.

Data reveal that the double disadvantage of immigrant women is evident with regard to both labor force participation and occupational attainment. Immigrant women are less likely than immigrant men to join the Israeli labor market, and they face much greater occupational loss. Data also reveal an interaction effect between gender and ethnicity. Immigrant women from the less developed countries in Asia and Africa constitute the most disadvantaged group. This group of women appears to be at a "triple disadvantage."},

  abstract = {Item Response Theory (IRT) has recently been proposed as a framework to measure deprivation. It allows deriving a latent measure of deprivation from a set of dichotomous observed items of deprivation and analyzing determinants of deprivation. We investigate further the use of IRT models in the field of deprivation measurement. Firstly, the paper emphasizes the importance of item selection and the Mokken Scale Procedure is applied in order to select the items to be included in the scale of deprivation. Secondly, we apply the one and the two-parameter probit IRT models for dichotomous items on two different sets of items, in order to highlight different empirical results. Finally, we introduce a graphical tool, the Item Characteristic Curve (ICC) and analyse the determinants of deprivation in Luxembourg. The empirical illustration is based on the fourth wave of the Luxembourg socioeconomic panel ``Liewen zu L\"etzebuerg'' (PSELL-3).},

Analysis of the 1995 population census indicates that, all else being equal, immigrant women exert a negative effect on activity in the annual labor force. As time elapses, the probability of immigrant women being employed improves but remains considerably lower than that of both immigrant and native-born men. However, after a few years in the country, immigrant women do close the gap with native-born women. For employment status in the last week, being an immigrant woman has a positive effect on full-time employment. A detailed analysis reveals substantial stratification by country of birth. Thus, the patterns of employment status for immigrant groups can reflect different levels (single, double, and triple) of disadvantage or advantage for women. I attach this stratification to cultural background and social values of country of birth as well as to economic and religious considerations, not fully indexed by the census data.},

We compare labor-force participation rate (LFPR) gaps between migrant and native-born women in nine European countries, and examine how these LFPR gaps change with migrant women's additional years in the receiving country. Consistent with the assimilation hypothesis, the LFPRs of migrant women in the ``old'' migrant-receiving countries of Western Europe begin much lower than for otherwise-comparable native-born women and converge, although not always completely, toward the LFPRs of native-born women with additional years lived in the country. In the ``new'' migrant-receiving countries of Southern Europe, however, the LFPRs of migrant women at all durations of residence are similar to those of native-born women. Additional descriptive evidence of high unemployment and under-employment and of difficulty achieving family work balance among Western European migrant women points toward receiving-country context as a major explanation for these empirical patterns.},

A thorough empirical analysis compares the poverty evaluations of the three poverty measures over time.

The weaker claim is that some systematic methodological reasoning should be conducted on how such a selection could be done. I will first suggest that Nussbaum's claim can be better understood by looking at some of the core differences between her and Sen's version of the capability approach. Then I will argue against the use of Nussbaum's list for quality of life measurement on grounds of epistemology and legitimacy. However, procedural methods also have their problems, notably the danger of selection biases. The paper concludes by sketching one possible way to minimize such biases and by briefly discussing a set of methods for the selection of capabilities for quality of life measurement.},

One increasingly influential way to think about these concepts is the capability approach, a theoretical framework which was pioneered by the philosopher and economist Amartya Sen in the 1980s. In this book Ingrid Robeyns orientates readers new to the capability approach through offering an explanation of this framework. Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice also endeavors to resolve historical disputes in the literature and thus will be equally engaging to those familiar with the field. The author offers a novel and illuminating account of how the capability approach can be understood in a variety of academic disciplines and fields of application. Special attention is paid to clarifying misunderstandings that have been caused by different disciplinary assumptions and the interpretive consequences they have for our consideration of the capability approach. Robeyns argues that respecting the distinction between the general capability approach, and more specific capability theories or applications, helps to clear up confusion and misinterpretation. In addition, the author presents detailed analyses of well-known objections to the capability approach, and also discusses how it relates to other schools of analysis such as theories of justice, human rights, basic needs, and the human development approach. Wellbeing, Freedom and Social Justice offers an original and comprehensive account of the field. The book will appeal to scholars of the capability approach as well as new readers looking for an interdisciplinary introduction.},

It shows that higher levels of religiosity can explain immigrants' more traditional attitudes to some extent, but that origin country socialization acts as an important additional determinant of attitudes of the first generation. Among second-generation migrants, only Muslims continue to hold more traditional attitudes. Acculturation for longer-staying migrants is partly explained by declining religiosity, with some evidence for a decoupling of attitudes from religious beliefs among female migrants in particular. Intergenerational change, on the other hand, cannot be attributed to a decline in the role of religiosity.},

The assessment of material deprivation and the identification of the households and individuals living in consistent poverty could become essential parts of the national anti-poverty strategy and crucial instruments in the definition of the target groups in social policy.},

It explores pov erty dynamics, in terms of characteristics and duration of poverty spells; it underlines the in teraction between critical events and changes in resource distribution (family, labour market and welfare) in determining the gender charac teristics of poverty trajectories; and it verifies the different combination of entry and exit events. The results show that women's greater vulnerability to economic poverty lies in two different elements: on the one hand, women's poverty spells are longer, and on the other hand they are particularly exposed to econ omic fluctuations. Moreover, the different demographic structures, labour market characteristics and welfare systems mean that there are substantial differences in the events causing the beginning or the end of poverty trajectories for women and men. From a com parison of the various regressions, it is clear that German women are more vulnerable to marital disruptions, while British female pov erty spells are more strongly related to unemployment and women's burden of care and domestic work, which have a profound effect on their ability to take up paid employ ment outside the home. The facilitation of women's integration/reintegration into the labour market (especially after family critical events such as divorce/separation) is an im portant event influencing the probability of leaving poverty in both settings.},

The relationship between women and poverty is complex and therefore very difficult to reveal. The disproportionate vulnerability of women arises from the interaction of economic disadvantages in the labour market, in domestic circumstances and in welfare systems. The methodological challenge that emerges now is 'how can we reveal the gender dimension of poverty?' My answer is that both a new and more suitable theoretical paradigm and a new methodology are required. Women's poverty cannot be understood and tackled using paradigms and methodological instruments based upon the view that poverty is a genderneutral phenomenon. Particularly, it is necessary to shed light on the different mechanisms behind women's poverty and to depict the crucial role played by the inequalities in the distribution of resources within the family in shaping women's well-being. Thus, longitudinal data are required, since they can efficiently estimate the parameters of dynamic processes in the social sciences. Moreover, specific methodological choices and full methodological awareness are needed: what is needed is a way of placing individuals within households. Finally, a higher data quality and a greater data comparability are required.},

We suggest that, when the actual political inclusion of migrants is con- sidered, Finland is not a model country: new residents are poorly represented in formal decision-making bodies.1 The same applies to the other Nordic countries, which, like Finland, presently confront chal- lenges to their long-term commitment to implementing human rights (Kvist et al, 2012). The Nordic welfare regime is one of many in the European Union, and in Finland in particular it was formulated well before migration began to increase, which took place as late as the early 1990s. In other words, new migrant-settlers have needed to adapt them- selves to a `ready-made' model. Proper representation and integration in decision-making are still only a vision: the norms and policies seem to be formulated for the migrants and not with them (Saarinen and J\"appinen, 2010a; see also Sum and Skjeie, 2008). Consequently, it is nec- essary to put the issue of political inclusion on the agenda as a matter of urgency. In this context we discuss the current economic and social challenges faced by the Finnish-Nordic regime.},

Using data from the German Socio-economic Panel from 2013 and 2015 we deal with interaction patterns of ethnic origin and gender regarding various labour market outcomes for immigrants from Turkey and the former Soviet Union. We analyse the impact of individual resources like education, language proficiency, and job characteristics on ethnic and gender gaps. We find evidence of additional disadvantages of immigrant women on each outcome variable that largely seem to be attributable to differences in qualifications and language proficiency. However, for women from the former Soviet Union and second-generation Turkish women specific disadvantages are apparent that cannot be explained by individual and job characteristics.},

  abstract = {Migration's Income and Poverty Impact Has Been Underestimated* This paper examines two issues associated with the impact of migration on household income and poverty. First, existing studies have typically overlooked a feature of migration that should be taken into account in estimating its impact, namely the fact that migration changes the size of the household. The `corrected' impact that does take the change in household size into account is presented analytically and is estimated on the basis of data from Ghana's GLSS household survey. The corrected impact is shown to be three to five times larger for income and two to three times larger for poverty than is obtained from standard analysis. Second, existing studies examine migration's impact on the poverty of the entire sample. However, some policy questions require measures of the impact on the poverty of the migrant households themselves. The latter is shown to be twenty times larger for international migration and two to three times larger for internal migration, compared to the impact for the entire sample. It is further shown that these results hold whether the poverty measures are corrected for the change in household size.},

(Autorenreferat)'The International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI) is frequently used as an indicator of socio-economic position in comparative analyses. The construction of ISEI status requires that occupations are coded according to the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO-88). This occupational information has been part of the German Mikrozensus Scientific Use Files since 1996. This paper describes how ISEI can be applied to the German Mikrozensus. Associations between ISEI and a number of other socio-economic variables are also analyzed. These demonstrate that the partial correlation between ISEI and income is rather small. The findings can be seen as a contribution to assessing the potential and limitations of ISEI in analysis.' (author's abstract)|},

We aim to identify the main drivers of this rise in income inequality since the early 1990s. We provide a broad overview of the circumstances under which inequality evolved, i.e. which changes in the German economy are most likely to provide an explanation for changes in income concentration. To explain the development of the distribution of net equivalized income we analyze changes in the distribution of market income as well as shifts in the effectiveness of public redistribution mechanisms. We find that cyclical and structural changes in the labor market, the increasing relevance of capital income as well as the decreasing effectiveness of the public mechanisms of income redistribution are the main explanatory factors for the development of income inequality. In addition to this, we discuss several issues that are of high relevance for the distribution of economic resources but are not directly covered in the analysis of net equivalized income. Most significantly, the design of the tax and social security contributions burden as well as the rising relevance of value-added taxes have exhibited negative redistributive effects for low income households.},

The effect of assimilation found by using the cohort approach, however (which acknowledges the possibility that patterns of labor force participation partly reflect the year of immigration), is still sizable. The effect is concentrated within the first 10 years after arrival. There are substantial differences in participation and assimilation by country of birth. Immigrants from Japan, Korea, and China are found to have experienced the greatest degree of assimilation, with an effect that raises the probability of working by 20 percentage points during the first 10 years after arriving in the United States.},

However, for a non-welfarist, it is necessary to `clean' the happiness measure to separate the `ethically' relevant information from the irrelevant noise. I suggest that the introduction of some ideas and concepts from the theory of responsibility-sensitive egalitarianism is a promising method to reinterpret the happiness results.},

  abstract = {Job quality is a multi-dimensional concept that has become prominent on the agenda of policy-makers. There is no consensus about how to measure and how to monitor it. In this paper we compare often used objective and subjective indicators of job quality. We argue that objective indicators are .too objective, as they neglect interindividual differences in preferences, while subjective job satisfaction is .too subjective, as it also reflects differences in aspirations. We propose an alternative measure of job quality in terms of equivalent incomes that does respect individual preferences but rules out aspirations. We illustrate our approach with Flemish data on school-leavers (SONAR) using the information on the .rst job of the 1978 birth cohort. We compare the results for the equivalent income indicator with the results of objective and subjective indicators.},

  abstract = {This chapter focuses on migration and integration as multilevel policy issues and explores the consequences in terms of multilevel governance. Immigration policymaking has been characterized by continued struggle between national governments and the EU about the amount of discretion states have in interpreting EU directives. The involvement of local and regional governments in debates about intra-EU migration, particularly East\textendash west migration from new member states, has further complicated the situation. Regarding integration, even more complex relations have emerged between local, regional, national, and EU institutions. The superdiverse cities of Europe, such as Barcelona, London, Berlin, and Rotterdam, have taken policy directions very different from their national governments, effectively ``decoupling'' national and local policies. While politicization of migrant integration continues to drive policies in many countries, the EU has developed various soft governance measures to promote policy learning between local governments. This chapter examines the recent evolution of migration and integration policies at the EU, national, and local levels, as well as the regional level. This enables us to understand the factors that drive policies at the different levels and the extent that these lead to convergence or divergence between the levels. Also analysed are the relations\textemdash or absence of relations\textemdash between levels of government. To make sense of these relations, a framework is applied that allows for different arrangements of relations. The notion of ``multilevel governance'' provides one possible way of structuring relations between various government levels.},

This approach tackles the problem that labor market effects from current language skills are at risk to reflect merely the sum of a successful residence in Germany and only display growth effects. I find that a good command of German increases labor market income by 47.0\% for males, while no significant language effects are detected for females. Further analyses illustrate that differences in language effects by gender can be attributed to selection into different occupations and part-time employments and that language operates complementary and enables cross-border transferability of human capital.},

The income of nearly half of the population has sunk below the poverty line, which has had an enormous impact on their emotional life. In this study, the relationship between income and satisfaction in Russia was examined. Three theories \textendash{} need, comparison, and personality theory \textendash{} were considered. Data were drawn from the first three waves of the Russet panel study (1993\textendash 1995). Russians were a little more satisfied with their income and life when they had a higher income. A positive change in income caused an increase in income-satisfaction over a one-year period. Results also showed that there was a reciprocal relationship between income-satisfaction and life satisfaction, indicating that in addition to bottom-up effects, top-down mechanisms were also at work: life satisfaction is partly a sum of domain satisfactions, but it also reflects a more trait-like character. Furthermore, within comparison theory, social comparison had the largest effect on income-satisfaction, closely followed by income needed (person-environment fit theory), and income deserved (equity theory) with the smallest effect. The need effect of income on income-satisfaction became non-significant when controlled for these three comparison mechanisms. Correction for measurement error of relationships between the endogenous variables resulted in overall stronger effects.},

Using before-tax Low Income Cut-Offs (LICO) as a measure, this analysis dissects the impact of time of arrival, age, marital status, racialization, and geographic setting in describing the Canadian immigrant experience of poverty. More recent immigrants appear to face a comparatively difficult entry into the Canadian labour market, though other factors such as age and marital status complicate this conclusion. Racialization also plays a role in determining the likelihood of poverty among Canadian immigrants, though not across all categories and contexts. Geography is also a key consideration here, where poverty is usually an urban phenomenon, particularly in the major gateway cities. While the overall conclusion is immigrants are more likely to be in poverty than the Canadian-born, this study demonstrates that this is a complex phenomenon with a number of variables that need to be considered.},

These trends strongly suggest that the economic well-being of racial/ethnic minorities and immigrant populations will be an increasingly salient question in the twenty-first century, not just for the members of such groups, but for American society as a whole. Indeed, with the overwhelmingly white baby boomers now beginning to reach retirement age, it will increasingly be non-white workers who will support the entitlement programs (i.e., Social Security and Medicare) upon which older Americans have come to depend after leaving the labor force.},

We offer six propositions from the sociology of racial discrimination that we believe economists should note. We argue that independent of taste and statistical discrimination, economists should study institutional discrimination; that institutional discrimination can take at least two forms, organizational and legal; that in both forms the decisions of a contemporary actor to discriminate can be immaterial; that institutional discrimination is a vehicle through which past discrimination has contemporary consequences; that minor forms of everyday interpersonal discrimination can be highly consequential; and that whether actors perceive they have experienced discrimination deserves attention in its own right.},

These data also allow estimates of the effects of social transfers that reduce poverty amongst all families with children. For all of the fourteen countries in the combined sample, children in migrant families have greater market-income poverty rates and greater disposable income poverty rates than do children in native-born families by a factor of about 2 to 1. Still, safety nets are important for all such families. For instance, before transfers, more than half of children in migrant families in France and Sweden are in poverty; however, after transfers, these rates are more than halved in these nations for both migrant and native-born children. In contrast, in the United States (US) the antipoverty effect of social transfers for both native and migrant families is negligible, because net transfers overall are insignificant in comparison with other rich countries. Thus the differences in benefits across countries, for both migrants and natives, are greater than are the differences within countries for these same groups. If the United States is to do better in fighting child poverty and realizing the economic and social potential of all of its children, it needs to expand its efforts on behalf of both immigrant and native children.},

The authors draw on a theoretical and meta-analytic review (210 studies composing 293 independent samples, 421 tests, and 186,073 respondents) to present a model that integrates group and individual RD. RD measures that (a) include justice-related affect, (b) match the outcome level of analysis, and (c) use higher quality measures yield significantly stronger relationships. Future research should focus on appropriate RD measurement, angry resentment, and the inclusion of theoretically relevant situational appraisals. Such methodological improvements would revitalize RD as a useful social psychological predictor of a wide range of important individual and social processes.},

While previous studies mainly focused on the influence of wages and earnings, we extend them by considering more dimensions describing the intensity of the woman's attachment to the labour market. We use the 2010 French Time Use survey to estimate a model of household division of labour in dual earner couples. We find that the more women are invested in career, the less domestic work they perform during weekdays, which is partly substituted by their partners but only on weekend days. The sharing of tasks is thus less unequal in those couples. However, women still spend more time than their partners on average performing domestic work, even when the woman outperforms him in career, implying no role reversal in the division of labour.},

There has been particular interest in the ways in which financial resources are distributed among individual household members. This, in turn, has led to the delineation of different systems of financial management. Methodologically, work in this domain has been informed by large-scale surveys and interview studies. The present paper contends that, due to their analytic reliance on the individual perceiver, current methods cannot fully account for the contradictions that are raised by key findings in the field. It is argued that a discursive approach, with the critical language awareness associated with it, might not only be able to reconcile some of these paradoxical findings but also provide the basis for a more critical understanding of the social\textendash psychological processes underlying household money management. The potential contribution of a discursive approach to studying the intra-household economy is illustrated by drawing on group interview data. This calls attention to (a) the inherent variability of people's accounts regarding their money management practices and (b) the identity processes involved in such `money talk'.},

  abstract = {Migrant selectivity refers to the idea that immigrants differ in certain characteristics from individuals who stay behind in their country of origin. In this article, we describe the selectivity profiles of recent migrants to Germany with respect to educational attainment, age and sex. We illustrate how refugees differ from labour migrants, and we compare the profiles of Syrian refugees who successfully completed the long journey to Europe to Syrian refugees who settled in neighbouring Lebanon or Jordan. We rely on destination-country data from the IAB-BAMF-GSOEP Survey of Refugees, the Arab Barometer, and the German Microcensus, as well as on a broad range of origin-country data sources. Regarding sex selectivity, males dominate among refugees in Germany, while among economic migrants, sex distributions are more balanced. Relative to their societies of origin, labour migrants are younger than refugees. At the same time, both types of migrants are drawn from the younger segments of their origin populations. In terms of educational attainment, many refugees compare rather poorly with average Germans' attainment, but well when compared to their origin populations. The educational profiles for labour migrants are mixed. Finally, Syrians who settle in Germany are younger, more likely to be male and relatively better educated than Syrians migrating to Jordan or Lebanon.           ,              Migranten unterscheiden sich in bestimmten Merkmalen von Personen, die im Herkunftsland verbleiben. Der vorliegende Beitrag widmet sich der Beschreibung dieser Selektivit\"atsprofile. Das Augenmerk richtet sich auf die Charakteristiken Bildung, Alter und Geschlecht. Einerseits wird untersucht, welche Unterschiede zwischen Gefl\"uchteten und Arbeitsmigranten zu beobachten sind; andererseits werden syrische Gefl\"uchtete, welche den weiten Weg nach Europa auf sich genommen haben, mit syrischen Gefl\"uchteten verglichen, die in die benachbarten L\"ander Libanon oder Jordanien gewandert sind. Die Analysen st\"utzen sich auf zwei Datens\"atze zu Neuzuwanderern in Deutschland, die IAB-BAMF-SOEP Befragung von Gefl\"uchteten und den Mikrozensus, sowie auf den Arab Barometer, der Informationen zu Syrern in Jordanien und dem Libanon beinhaltet. Au\ss erdem wird eine Vielzahl von Datenquellen aus den jeweiligen Herkunftsl\"andern genutzt. W\"ahrend unter Gefl\"uchteten in Deutschland vor allem M\"anner vertreten sind, erweist sich die Geschlechterverteilung unter Arbeitsmigranten als ausgeglichener. Dar\"uber hinaus sind Arbeitsmigranten, verglichen mit der Bev\"olkerung im jeweiligen Herkunftsland, j\"unger als Gefl\"uchtete. Gleichzeitig zeigt sich f\"ur Arbeitsmigranten und Gefl\"uchtete gleicherma\ss en, dass sie zu den j\"ungeren Segmenten ihrer jeweiligen Herkunftsgesellschaft geh\"oren. Hinsichtlich der Bildungsselektivit\"at l\"asst sich festhalten, dass Gefl\"uchtete im Vergleich zur deutschen Bev\"olkerung zwar zumeist schlechter gebildet sind, dass sie jedoch im Vergleich zur Herkunftsbev\"olkerung einen h\"oheren Bildungsstand aufweisen. Die Bildungsprofile von Arbeitsmigranten erweisen sich dagegen als heterogen. Syrische Gefl\"uchtete, die sich in Deutschland niedergelassen haben, sind j\"unger, h\"aufiger m\"annlich und vergleichsweise besser gebildet als Syrer, die nach Jordanien oder in den Libanon gewandert sind.},

  abstract = {This article aims to gain a better understanding of the explanatory value of work ethic and traditional gender role values with regard to variation in female labour market supply. Although women's labour market participation has increased dramatically over the past decades, it still lacks behind that of men. A high female participation rate is desirable for several reasons, for instance to cover rising costs due to the ageing of society. The existing literature has mostly focused on micro-economic and macro factors to explain differences between women in participation rate. However, more recently it has been argued that women's values may also play an important role in women's labour market decisions. Work ethic, expressing the moral duty to work in terms of paid employment, is argued to positively affect women's labour supply. However, it is argued that it can have negative implications too if women who hold more traditional gender role values interpret work and work ethic in terms of housework or in terms of paid employment for men only. This exemplifies the need to study both values at the same time. We used longitudinal Dutch data (LISS panel, 2007\textendash 2010) and estimated both cross-sectional and longitudinal models. Both types of models revealed a similar pattern: work ethic is positively associated with women's labour market participation, but only if we take into account women's gender role values, which negatively relate to women's labour market supply.},

We focus on job applicants originating from countries that have a substantial Muslim population: of these, some signalled closeness to Islam in their job application while others did not. With this design, we can empirically disentangle anti-Muslim discrimination (a `disclosed Muslim' effect) from the possible stigma of originating from countries where Islam is prevalent (a `Muslim by default' effect). Our double-comparative design allows us to compare the extent of anti-Muslim discrimination faced by different origin groups in destination countries characterised by a varying history of church-state relations and distinctive approaches to grant cultural and religious rights to minorities. We find alarming levels of discrimination, especially towards male applicants from more visible groups. Anti-Muslim discrimination and origin-based discrimination independently contribute to the severe disadvantage faced by ethnic and religious minorities, a disadvantage that is especially severe in the Norwegian labour market.},

We distinguish different groups in the labour market with respect to working-time, gender and region by exploiting data from the German Socio-Economic panel (GSOEP) for the years 1995 till 2014. Using the decomposition of the Theil1-index we demonstrate that the increase in earnings inequality is primarily the result of diverging average earnings of the various groups in the labour market (between-group inequality) and to some extent due to increasing earnings heterogeneity within groups (within-group inequality). The former effect is larger than the latter. Without the inequality reducing effect on earnings inequality due to the continuous decrease in the share of full-time working employees and the increase in the female labour participation rate (compositional effect) earnings inequality would have actually further increased after 2010. Independent of the policy target, policy measures to reduce inequality need always to be designed in such a way that they take the whole work force into account in order to achieve measurable effects.},

These models incorporate observable personal and household characteristics, as well as unobserved heterogeneity. My findings emphasize the importance of considering multiple spells in an analysis of poverty persistence. For black and white individuals falling into poverty in some year, approximately 50 and 30 percent, respectively, will have family income below the poverty line in at least five of the next ten years. A single spells approach predicts comparable figures of only 26 and 13 percent. To check the robustness of these predictions I also utilize two alternative approaches \textendash{} direct tabulations from panel data and estimation of a components-of-variance model \textendash{} and compare predictions of poverty persistence based on the three methods.},

On the micro level, it examines the effects of women's employment on the odds of their household being poor, and, on the macro level, it examines the effects of women's employment on poverty rates in society. Analysing Israel's 1996 Income Survey, our findings confirm the general argument that women's employment is negatively related to poverty, in both female- and couple-headed households. The findings show that poverty levels are substantially lower in households in which women participate in the labour market, either on a full-time or on a part-time basis, than in households in which the woman is not economically active. At the macro level, our simulations demonstrate that increasing women's employment, even to a part-time level, would reduce poverty in both couple- and female-headed households, and would reduce the economic disparities between these two types of households. Our findings also suggest that while universal employment of female heads of household has an unequivocal equalizing effect on poverty rates, universal employment of women in couple-headed households increases the poverty rate. These findings reveal the different selection processes of women in female- and couple-headed households into paid employment.},

Based on the capability approach this paper gives an empirical analysis of socio-demographic and socio-economic determinants of social exclusion from the labour market in Germany. We conceptualise social exclusion as lack of instrumental freedoms (or social conversion factors) and argue that Sen's distinction between social exclusion and unfavourable inclusion may be very helpful when analysing labour market issues. Special emphasis is put on the fact that the phenomena of social exclusion and unfavourable inclusion can both be interpreted within an individual and within a household context.},

Our analyses draw on data from the Socio-Economic Panel (German SOEP from 1991 to 2014), distinguishing between populations with and without a migration background. Random effects hourly wage regressions controlling for selection bias using Heckman procedure have been estimated in our analysis. The results show that there are large gender differences in hourly wage at younger ages, and these differences are maintained over the life course. Regarding migration status, no significant disadvantages in wages are observable at early stages. However, disadvantages of men and women with migration background increase with age, resulting in lower earnings for older workers with migration background. When we analyse the interaction between migration and gender, we observe no effect either at younger ages or over the entire lifespan, indicating that the gender disadvantage is no more pronounced for women with migration background than for women without such a background (and vice versa).},

Therefore, I explore the conditions and assumptions under which capability deprivation can be inferred from readily available consumption data. Specifically, to detect capability deprivation I draw on the notion of an inadequate income together with nonconsumption data of pivotal goods. The results indicate capability deprivation to reduce life satisfaction significantly. Moreover, the evidence also suggests that individuals fail to adapt within the subsequent four to six years. Finally, the mere lowness of income fails to capture its inadequacy.},

Importantly, the results suggest that genuine multidimensional measures add unique insights, which neither a single indicator, nor a dashboard approach can offer.

Operationalisation and empirical implementation of the measure are conceptually guided by the capability approach. Essentially, the paper argues that deprivation in social participation can be convincingly established by drawing on extensive non-participation in customary social activities. In doing so, the present paper synthesizes philosophical considerations, axiomatic research on poverty and deprivation, and previous empirical research on social exclusion and subjective well-being. An application using high-quality German survey data supports the measure's validity. Specifically, the results suggest, as theoretically expected, that the proposed measure is systematically different from related concepts like material deprivation and income poverty. Moreover, regression techniques reveal deprivation in social participation to reduce life satisfaction substantially, quantitatively similar to unemployment. Finally, questions like preference vs. deprivation, cross-country comparisons, and the measure's suitability as a social indicator are discussed.},

Since the early 1980s all four Southern European countries of the EU, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy, have been transformed from emigration into immigration countries.

Using 2011 French census data, I examine Sub-Saharan African immigrants' occupational segregation. I find that all immigrants are concentrated, but only Sub-Saharan Africans are concentrated in low-skilled work regardless of citizenship. Department-level regression analyses measuring occupational segregation show that after controlling for socioeconomic characteristics, SubSaharan Africans are most segregated. Control variables explain less of SubSaharan African women's segregation than any other group indicating that they experience more discrimination in the labour market than even SubSaharan African men. Future research using longitudinal data is needed to determine if these results reflect a persistent disadvantage.},

Using country-level data from the early 1980s for 18 OECD countries, we estimate the influence of labour market and institutional characteristics on female labour force participation, and full-time and part-time employment participation. The relationship (interactions, complementarity) between different policy measures is also analyzed, as well as potential variations in the influence of policies across different Welfare regimes. The results first highlight how the increase in female educational attainment, the expansion of the service sector the increase in parttime employment opportunities have boosted women's participation in the labour force. By contrast, there is no such clear relationship between female employment rates and the growing share of public employment. Employment rates react to changes in tax rates, in leave policies, but the rising provision of childcare formal services to working parents with children not yet three years old is a main policy driver of female labour force participation. Different policy instruments interact with each other to improve overall effectiveness. In particular, the coverage of childcare services is found to have a greater effect on women's participation in the labour market in countries with relatively high degrees of employment protection. The effect of childcare services on female full-time employment is particularly strong in Anglophone and Nordic countries. In all, the findings suggest that the effect of childcare services on female employment is stronger in the presence of other measures supporting working mothers (as, for instance paid parental leave) while the presence of such supports seems to reduce the effectiveness of financial incentives to work for second earners. The effect of cash benefits for families and the duration of paid leave on female labour force participation also vary across welfare regimes.},

We use a harmonised field experiment to test whether discrimination against job candidates of Turkish origin (age 23\textendash 25) varies across Germany and the Netherlands, while holding individual characteristics of job seekers constant. We find that, compared to majority candidates, job candidates of Turkish origin are on average eleven percentage points less likely to receive a positive call-back. Moreover, we find that discrimination against Turkish minorities is significantly higher in the Netherlands than in Germany. In Germany, job candidates of Turkish origin are five percentage points less likely to receive a call-back than equally qualified majority candidates, whereas in the Netherlands this ethnic gap is fifteen percentage points. However, the presented evidence does not support the often-mentioned argument that the amount of diagnostic information in application materials explains why discrimination against Turkish minorities is lower in Germany. Overall, adding diagnostic information has little effect on the relative employment chances of job applicants of Turkish origin, both in Germany and the Netherlands.},

Presently we possess the analytical tools to identify and locate the poor, to describe their characteristics and to measure the extent of poverty at different levels of aggregation. Yet, in spite of spectacular methodological advances in the analysis of poverty a number of conceptual and measurement issues remains to be addressed or further clarified. Ravi Kanbur (2002) has argued that the research on distributional issues in economics and development economics in the last thirty years can be divided roughly into two periods: (i) the 1970s to the mid-1980s and (ii) the mid-1980s to the end of the last century. The first 15 years were a `period of great conceptual leaps and ferment' while the second period was marked by `consolidation, application and fierce policy debate'. Very recent methodological contributions suggest that we are entering a period of resurgence in research attempting to sharpen and broaden our view of poverty.},

I suggest that aggressive integrationism is reflective of a distinctly `Schmittian' liberalism, which aims to clarify the core values of liberal societies and use coercive state power to protect them from illiberal and putatively dangerous groups. In contrast to liberal multiculturalists, who counsel accommodation, compromise and negotiation among majority and minority groups, Schmittian liberals see the task of immigrant integration as part of a broader campaign to preserve `Western civilisation' from illiberal threats. Their framing of the problem in existentialist terms allows them to justify policies that might otherwise be seen to contravene liberal principles of toleration and equality. As such, Schmittian liberalism complicates our understanding of liberal states' approaches to immigration and immigrant integration policies.},

  abstract = {There has been a shift in the public discourse of many EU countries from `poverty' to `social exclusion'. This article treats chronic cumulative disadvantage as a proxy for `social exclusion' and provides an empirical application using data from the ECHP. Social exclusion appears to be more widespread in Southern European countries with relatively underdeveloped welfare states and the countries associated with the `Liberal' welfare state regime. The results of multivariate analysis demonstrate that in most countries, lack of full-time employment, low educational qualifications, lone parenthood, non-EU citizenship and bad health are positively and significantly associated with increased risk of social exclusion. In contrast, the effect of being an elderly citizen living alone or a member of an elderly couple is found to be negatively associated with the risk of social exclusion in Northern but positively in Southern Europe. Finally, country and welfare regime effects turn out to be significant in explaining the probability of social exclusion.},

  abstract = {The years 1998 to 2003 were marked by a deterioration in the economic situation of the German population with an immigrant background as the share of immigrants living below the poverty line increased at an above average rate. The older and younger age groups in this segment of the population are particularly prone to poverty. The Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) survey, which is carried out by the DIW Berlin in collaboration with the Infratest Social Research Institute, shows that 28\% of children and young people aged under 20 with an immigrant background were living in precarious circumstances in 2003. The share of native Germans of the same age living in such circumstances was substantially lower, albeit still disturbingly high at 20\%. Citizens of Turkish origin, in particular, are frequently found living below the poverty line. Immigrants from Western countries, by contrast, live comparatively rarely in poverty. Naturalised Germans are better off on average than foreign nationals, although this is not true for ethnic Germans. The fact that poverty is not a transitory phenomenon but an enduring condition for many immigrants is particularly alarming. Only improved education and training will solve this problem in the long term. The recruitment of foreign labour, the admission of refugees and the return of ethnic German settlers from former Eastern Bloc countries have culminated in large waves of immigration to Germany over the last 50 years. On official figures, over seven million foreign nationals and over four million ethnic Germans are living in Germany today. Germany still has a net migration surplus, although it has diminished significantly in recent years.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to better understand the possible reasons behind gender pay disparities, focussing on the unique features of male and female human capital and their wage returns. Despite increasing convergence of male and female human capital attainments, substantial differences remain. Extraction of human capital components non-overlapping across genders provides more profound explanation of the unexplained wage gap of men and women. Design/methodology/approach Starting with the non-parametric matching-based decomposition technique, the authors extend the pay gap estimation framework and focus on males and females having no counterpart in a set of characteristics within the opposite gender. The authors identify gender-unique human capital in terms of differences in distribution of individual characteristics across men and women and gender-specific combination of human capital characteristics. Wage returns to gender-specific profiles are evaluated applying wage regression on both full distribution of earnings and wage quantiles. The research relies on the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) database for Estonia, which incorporates both formal education and cognitive skill records. Findings The study identifies sets of characteristics and competencies exclusive for both genders, proving that male and female profiles cannot be directly compared. The results suggest that men possess high individual and combined abilities in numeracy and problem solving in technology-rich environment, not always reached by females. This potentiates men's higher earnings in spite of their generally lower formal educational attainments. Wage gap analysis over the full distribution of earnings shows even larger ``glass ceiling'' effect for females, possessing woman-specific human capital. Originality/value The authors raise a research from a novel perspective towards a role of human capital in gender wage inequality. Instead of usual reference to observable gaps in male and female characteristics, the authors identify the gender-specific human capital profiles, to a large extent non-reached by the opposite gender. Analysed associations between gender-specific characteristics and earnings provide an insight to possible effects of gender-unique human capital on a male-female wage disparity.},

Evidence about poverty persistence is an important complement to information about poverty prevalence at a point in time. Estimates of persistent at risk of poverty rates are derived from the longitudinal component of EU SILC in which the fortunes of individuals are tracked over four consecutive years, in principle. In practice, not all of the individuals present in the first sample year provide four years of income data: there is attrition and estimates of persistent at risk of poverty measure may therefore not be reliable. Rates of attrition from the four-year EU-SILC samples used to calculate persistent poverty rates vary substantially across Member States, and there is also substantial cross-national diversity in the characteristics of individuals lost to follow-up. This working paper documents such patterns in detail and provides evidence that application of longitudinal weights does not fully account for the effects of attrition, and that different assumptions about the poverty status of attritors lead to wide bounds for estimates of persistent poverty rates for most Member States.},

Less than a decade ago, being employed yet living in poverty was considered a marginal issue only relevant for the Anglo-Saxon countries (think about the rhetoric surrounding the so-called Mcjobs). Nevertheless, scholars and policymakers are nowadays increasingly worried about the incidence of in-work poverty in all European member states (Andre{$\beta$} and Lohmann, 2008; Lohmann, 2009; Fraser et al., 2011; Crettaz, 2011; Marx et al., 2012). These concerns are paralleled by the growing emphasis on flexibility to help increase employment rates and render European labour markets more adaptable to structural changes and the emergence of new risks (Viebrock and Clasen, 2009). More flexibility on the labour market is often translated in non-standard forms of employment like temporary employment, assumed to improve employment chances for weak labour market profiles on the one hand and to give employers a less costly opportunity to adapt the number of employees to fluctuating levels of demand on the other hand (Booth et al., 2002). However, previous research has shown that temporary employment can also have problematic consequences in terms of job security, income security, employer-provided social security benefits and on-the-job training (Leschke and Watt, 2008).},

The authors argue that two macro designs must be combined to provide a more comprehensive perspective on the economic integration of immigrant groups. Instead of reliance on observations of multiple-origin groups in a single destination or a single-origin group in multiple destinations, multiple origins in multiple destinations are compared, suggesting that the economic status of immigrants may be affected by the country from which they come (``origin effect''), the country to which they migrate (``destination effect''), and the specific relations between origins and destinations (``community effect''). From the human capital theory, compositional hypotheses are derived, which predict that these macro effects can be attributed to the selection of human capital. From discrimination theories, contextual hypotheses are deduced, which maintain that macro effects can be ascribed to in-group preferences and out-group prejudices. Data on immigrants' labor force activity and employment in 18 Western countries during the period 1980 to 2001 are reported. Using multilevel techniques, the analysis shows that compositional differences associated with political suppression in the countries of origin, relative income inequality, and geographic distance affect the labor force status of immigrants. Contextual effects play a role as well in terms of religious origin, the presence of left wing parties in the government, and the size of the immigrant community.},

The literature on in-work poverty focuses on occupational polarization, human capital, demographic characteristics, and welfare generosity. However, we have no knowledge on the effects of family demographic processes on in-work poverty across individuals' life courses. Objective: We estimate the risk of in-work poverty in the United States over the life course as a function of family demographic processes, namely leaving the parental home, union formation and dissolution, and the transition to parenthood. Methods: We use data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) and fixed effects regression models with interactions between age and each family demographic process to estimate age-specific associations between these processes and the probability of in-work poverty. Results: In-work poverty is a common phenomenon across the life courses of our study cohort: 20\% of individuals are at risk of in-work poverty at every age. However, the risk generally decreases for men and increases for women across the life course. Leaving the parental home, entering parenthood, and separation increase, while marriage decreases the risk of in-work poverty. While the associations between marital statuses and in-work poverty are stable over the life course, the associations between parental home leaving and fertility with in-work poverty vary by age. Contribution: Our findings demonstrate the importance of family demographic processes over and above traditional stratification factors for the risk of in-work poverty. Associations between family demographic processes and in-work poverty estimated for all age groups may be grossly underestimated.},

Large scale labour force surveys conducted by Statistics Netherlands from 1977 onwards show that a partner's career resources have a negative influence on working hours and a positive influence on job level.

The conventional poor/non-poor dichotomy is replaced by defining poverty as a matter of degree, determined by the place of the individual in the income distribution. The same methodology facilitates the inclusion of other dimensions of deprivation into the analysis: by appropriately weighting indicators of deprivation to reflect their dispersion and correlation, we can construct measures of non-monetary deprivation in its various dimensions. An important contribution of the paper is to identify rules for the intersection and union of fuzzy sets appropriate for the study of poverty and deprivation. These rules allow us to meaningfully study the persistence of poverty and deprivation over time. We establish the consistency of the approach when applied to a time sequence of any length. We can thus study longitudinally over time a whole range of indicators of poverty and deprivation, from cross-sectional monetary poverty rates to multi-dimensional indicators of deprivation: in particular, we propose the new ``Fuzzy At-persistent-risk-of-poverty rate'', and compare it with the corresponding Laeken indicator adopted by Eurostat.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND In Spain, foreign-born women are disproportionately employed in housework or care work, and quantitative research has shown that female migrants are disadvantaged relative to male migrants in the occupational status of their first job in Spain. However, the process that created this female penalty has not yet been explored. OBJECTIVE In this paper, we focus on female occupational mobility at migration and during settlement in Spain. First, we compare female and male labour mobility at migration. Second, we identify the main socio-demographic factors which increase the likelihood that the first job a foreign-born woman holds in Spain will be as a cleaner or a domestic worker. Third, we investigate female labour mobility from the time of migration, particularly trajectories that lead away from the cleaning and domestic occupations, and consider the importance of the assimilation process in occupational mobility. METHODS We apply quantitative methods to Spain's 2007 National Immigrant Survey (Encuesta Nacional de Inmigrantes), using descriptive (mobility matrixes) and simple and multinomial logistic regression analyses. We include the main socio-demographic, family, and migratory characteristics of immigrants in the explanatory models. RESULTS The results of our analysis revealed that female migrants to Spain are more likely than their male counterparts to experience occupational downgrading at the time of migration, and that 41.6\% of women work in domestic services in their first job in Spain. Finally, our results have demonstrated that, although occupational immobility is common among female migrants in Spain, movement out of domestic services is possible, especially for the most assimilated immigrant women. CONCLUSIONS This paper contextualises female immigration in Spain, attributing the labour market choices made by female migrants to the externalisation of domestic and cleaning occupations in private households, and to the gender segmentation of the labour market.},

  abstract = {Objective: Migration rates of dual-earner couples are lower than those of male-breadwinner couples. We revisit this issue using a cross-national comparative perspective and examine heterogeneity in the role of female employment in couple relocations. We propose a theoretical framework in which national levels of support for female employment and normative expectations about gender roles act as moderators of the relationship between couple type (i.e., dual-earner and male-breadwinner) and family migration. Methods: We deploy discrete-time event history analyses of harmonised longitudinal data from four large-scale datasets from Australia, Britain, Germany, and Sweden, covering the 1992-2011 period. Results: Consistent with prior research, we find that male-breadwinner couples migrate more often than dual-earner couples in all countries, suggesting that traditional gender structures affecting family migration operate across very different contexts. We also find cross-country differences in the estimated effects of different sorts of absolute and relative partner resources on family migration. Conclusions: We take our results as preliminary evidence that national contexts can serve as moderators of the relationship between within-couple employment arrangements and family migration decisions. Contribution: Our study contributes to family migration literature by illustrating how cross-national comparisons are a valuable methodological approach to put prevailing micro-level explanations of the relationship between female employment and family migration in context.},

However, most earlier research has been based on relatively small samples. Here a major new British data set, produced by the Social Change and Economic Life Initiative, is used to examine the relations between money, power and inequality within marriage. Six different systems of financial allocation are identified. The results suggest that even when couples nominally pool their money, in practice either husband or wife is likely to control the pool. In only one fifth of couples was the pool jointly controlled, but these households were characterised by the highest levels of equality between husband and wife in terms of decision making, experience of deprivation and access to personal spending money., Findings from the study indicate a complex pattern of relationships between household income level, household allocative system and gender. Female control of finances, though it was associated with greater decision-making power for women, did not protect them against financial deprivation; however, male control of finances, especially when it took the form of the housekeeping allowance, did serve to protect the financial interests of men in comparison with women. Gender inequality was least in households with joint control of pooled money and greatest either in low income households or in higher income households with male control of finances.},

Subsequent criticisms have mainly centred around the concept of power that we used in those papers. It has been suggested that we either lacked a theory of power (Rottman, 1996) or that our conceptualisation of power as control over decision making was too limited (Shove, 1993). I would argue however, that while it was not made explicit in our original papers our findings point towards a more general theory of power in the household, namely to a modified version of Lukes' three dimensional model of power. While we initially conceptualised power as control over decision making (Lukes' first dimension of power) our findings also show the importance of ideological and cultural factors (Lukes' third dimension of power) as both a cause and a consequence of the allocative systems couples use to organise money within the household. More theoretically, I also suggest that discourses about money within the household may be part of, and operate in a similar way to discourses of decision making at the broader political level. It may therefore be possible to conceptualise the different ways of managing money within the household as mini political systems akin to different sorts of democracy at the broader political level, and with similar consequences for gender relations.},

The analysis indicates that by 2002, the type of relationship respondents had established, together with their social class position, were both independently related to the ways in which they managed money, after controlling for socio-economic and cultural or discursive factors. Our findings also provide a degree of support for the thesis of a partial decline in the male breadwinner model of gender, as indicated by small declines in the use of the relatively inegalitarian female whole wage and housekeeping allowance systems which were most likely to be used by married couples and cohabiting fathers, expressing relatively traditional ideologies/discourses of breadwinning \textendash{} and a slight increase in the use of the partial pool, which was most likely to be used by childless cohabiting couples in which male partners expressed less traditional ideologies of breadwinning and women were in middle-class jobs with incomes high enough to facilitate partially separate finances. We also suggest, however, that in so far as cohabiting couples earning different amounts define equality as contributing equally to household expenditure, it is possible that rather than being associated with shifts to greater equality in access to money for personal spending and saving, the partial pool may be associated with marked inequalities, because it may enable gender inequalities generated in the labour market to be more directly transposed into inequalities within households, despite the decline of traditional discourses of male breadwinning and the increasing importance of egalitarian ideologies of co-provisioning.},

Our findings show that while in general, keeping money partly separate was associated with a relatively high level of male control, which was more visible to female respondents than male control in other systems, a minority of (sometimes) higher earning, cohabiting women with partly separate finances, were able to make autonomous decisions about spending, possibly by using their own personal spending money. However, the analysis also indicates that when either men or women made autonomous decisions about spending, both male and female respondents were less satisfied with family life, as well as with life in general, than those who made joint decisions.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the strategies used by immigrant families to reconcile work and care for young children in Finland, France, Italy and Portugal. Drawing upon interviews with couples or lone parents who have children below age ten, it shows that immigrant families rely on a diversity of work/care strategies. These strategies include extensive delegation of care (mostly to formal or non-familial informal care), negotiation of care within the nuclear family (both partners sharing the care responsibilities as well as older child care), mother-centredness (mothers cutting back on working hours), child negligence (leaving children alone) and the superimposition of care upon work (taking children to work). Almost all immigrant families, but especially first-generation ones, suffer from the absence of close kin networks to support childcare, strong pressure to work and from work (long or atypical hours) and various integration problems such as social isolation, lack of information on services, and problems with housing. However, our findings show that migration patterns, among other factors, have a significant impact on work/care strategies. Highly qualified ``professional migration'' is more associated with extensive paid delegation (often private and high-cost), ``marriage migration'' with mother-centredness, and ``unskilled worker migration'' with low-cost solutions supplemented by workplace care, older child care and negligence. First-generation unskilled worker migrant families are more exposed to occupational and residential segregation, atypical working hours, low earnings and difficulties in managing work and care for young children. Findings point to the still weak regulatory function of the different welfare states in the protection of these families.},

The article focuses first on the path followed by Portugal in the fields of immigration, employment, welfare-state developments and care arrangements, and then presents results of a qualitative study on Brazilian immigrant women. Findings show that the new plurality of female migration trajectories is an important factor in explaining the rapid integration of immigrant women in the domestic sector. This does not mean, however, that a predominant `migrant in the family' care model has emerged in Portugal. In contrast with other southern European countries, different policy perspectives and outcomes over the last three decades have made for a more diversified care model. National contexts in southern European countries must therefore be taken into account, since they provide particular conditions for the main forms and features of migrant domestic work.},

The authors discuss conceptualizations of work and its relationship to gender and mobility, and application to a northern context. They argue that investigation into the gendered aspects of geographical employment mobilities requires analysing women and men as gendered actors across a variety of spatial scales. It also requires attention to a multitude of mobility contexts and implications that may operate simultaneously. Further, it demands a critical investigation of how gender tends to disappear as an analytical aspect when institutional arrangements and knowledge production take precedence over the immediate practices of everyday life, resulting in gender-blind discourses and failure to see gendered hierarchies. The article shows that women and men's entries and exits into the labour market, and the nature, location, and occupational category of their employment, are shaped by the intersectional relations between gender, class, race, ethnicity, age, and culture. The authors argue that prior to an intersectional consideration it is necessary to examine the interconnections between workplace, household, and the means and conditions of transport. Social and economic interconnectedness exists around the North Atlantic rim, including mobility internally and internationally.},

However, social policy still tends to address the different dimensions of QoL\textemdash such as poverty, health, housing and social cohesion\textemdash in isolation. This raises the question of the variation across dimensions or groups in the extent of multidimensionality. For instance, are housing or health problems experienced by people with a range of other QoL problems, or do they tend to occur in isolation? Does this differ between social risk groups, such as lone parents, older adults or children? The answers have implications for the service needs of people with health problems or with inadequate housing. We address these issues in this paper, analysing the 2013 quality of life module on the EU-SILC data for Ireland and adapting the adjusted headcount ratio methodology of Alkire and Foster to address the issue of multidimensionality.},

Such an approach can lead to an identification of a sub-set of poor individuals facing particularly adverse circumstances and/or distinctive problems in escaping from poverty. Here we seek to establish whether, in comparison with cross-sectional measures, persistent poverty measures also provide a better measure of exclusion from a minimally acceptable way of life and relate with other important variables in a logical fashion. Our analysis draws upon the first three waves of the ECHP and shows that a persistent poverty measure does constitute a significant improvement over its crosssectional counterpart in the explanation of levels of deprivation. Persistent poverty is related to life-style deprivation in a manner that comes close to being uniform across countries. The measure of persistence also conforms to our expectations of how a poverty measure should behave in that, unlike relative income poverty lines, defining the threshold level more stringently enables us to identify progressively groups of increasingly deprived respondents. Overall the persistent poverty measure constitutes a significant advance on cross-sectional income measures. However, there is clearly a great deal relating to the process of accumulation and of erosion of resources, which is not fully captured in the persistent poverty measure. In the absence of such information, there is a great deal to be said for making use of both types of indictors in formulating and evaluating policies while we continue to improve our understanding of longer-term processes.},

In contrast with the rather ad hoc way in which the EU 2020 poverty target has been framed and rationalized, the adjusted head count ratio applied here has a number of desirable axiomatic properties. It constitutes a significant improvement on union and intersection approaches and allows for the decomposition of multidimensional poverty in terms of dimensions of deprivation and socio-economic attributes. Since understanding poverty as multidimensional does not necessarily require constructing a multidimensional poverty index, on the basis of our analysis we provide a more general consideration of the value of developing a multidimensional index of poverty for the EU.},

We proceed to extend our consideration to multidimensional approaches to quality of life which have involved macro and micro approaches to developing aggregate measures that go well beyond the normal concerns of poverty research. In so doing, we will seek to show that while all of these approaches must face key judgements relating to choices of dimensions, thresholds, weighting and aggregation, there is significant variation in the challenges posed in relation to the scale of aggregation, the degree of multidimensionality aspired to and the availability of data sources that match such ambitions.

To evaluate whether timing effects such as fertility disruption or an interrelation of marriage, migration and childbirth occur, we examine first and second births in the years before and after immigration to Germany. The Turkish sample of the Generations and Gender Survey which was conducted in 2006 offers the unique opportunity to examine Turkish immigrants as a single immigrant category. We question the common understanding that Turkish immigrants who arrived to Germany after 1973 mainly arrived for family reunification resulting in high birth intensities immediately after immigration. To distinguish different circumstances under which male and female immigrants have arrived to Germany, we include the combined marriage and migration history of the couple. We find that first birth probabilities are elevated during the years immediately following migration. But this effect is not universal among migrants with different marriage and migration histories. It appears that the arrival effect of high birth intensities is particularly high among female immigrants and is evident only among marriage migrants, that is Turks who married a partner who already lived in Germany at the time of the wedding. By contrast, among those who immigrated for family reunification, we do not find such an arrival effect.},

  abstract = {Die Einb\"urgerung von Ausl\"andern in Deutschland ist seit l\"angerem ein wichtiges Thema der Integrationspolitik. Im Working Paper 17 wird zun\"achst ein \"Uberblick zu den einschl\"agigen Datenquellen (amtliche Statistik, Mikrozensus sowie verschiedene Surveys der empirischen Sozialforschung) sowie zu den Rechtsgrundlagen der Einb\"urgerung in Deutschland gegeben. Anschlie\ss end wird die Entwicklung der Einb\"urgerungszahlen seit dem Jahr 2000 analysiert, unter anderem nach Herkunftsl\"andern, Alter und Geschlecht der Eingeb\"urgerten. Ein weiteres Kapitel thematisiert den Umfang von doppelter bzw. mehrfacher Staatsangeh\"origkeit in Deutschland anhand des Mikrozensus und im Kontext der Einb\"urgerung, z.B. bei den sog. "Optionskindern". Erg\"anzend zu diesen amtlichen Daten bieten Erhebungen der empirischen Sozialforschung Erkenntnisse zur Einb\"urgerungsbereitschaft und den dahinterliegenden Motiven von Ausl\"andern. Im Rahmen des Working Papers werden entsprechende Auswertungen des Sozio-\"Okonomischen Panels (SOEP) und der vom BAMF durchgef\"uhrten Repr\"asentativuntersuchung Ausgew\"ahlte Migrantengruppen in Deutschland 2006/2007 (RAM) vorgestellt. Abschlie\ss end wird anhand von ALLBUS-Daten thematisiert, welche Einstellungen es in der deutschen Bev\"olkerung zur Einb\"urgerung von Ausl\"andern gibt und wie sich diese Einstellungen im Zeitverlauf ver\"andert haben.The naturalisation of foreigners in Germany has been an important topic of integration policy for a considerable time. Working Paper 17 starts by providing an overview of the relevant data sources (official statistics, microcensus and various surveys of empirical social research), as well as on the legal basis of naturalisation in Germany. Then, the development of the naturalisation figures since 2000 is analysed, including by the countries of origin, age and sex of the naturalised persons. Another chapter discusses the scope of dual and multiple nationality in Germany using the Microcensus and in the context of naturalisation, for instance among so-called "option children". In addition to these official data, surveys of empirical social research offer knowledge on willingness to be naturalised and the motives for this among foreigners. Corresponding evaluations of the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and of the (RAM - Representative survey on selected migrant groups in Germany) implemented by the BAMF are presented in the working paper. It is then discussed using ALLBUS data what attitudes there are among the German population towards the naturalisation of foreigners and how these attitudes have changed over time.},

  urldate = {2020-08-18},
  abstract = {Obtaining a permit to work in Switzerland depends on many factors, including where you are from, the skills you have and quotas. Switzerland has a dual system for allowing foreigners to work while in the country. The first concerns citizens from the European Union and/or the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), who are generally allowed to come to Switzerland for three months while they look for work. The period can be extended to six months during an active job hunt with a special short-term permit, issued if you are registered at a regional employment centre and have a good chance of being able to find a job. This permit can be extended for up to a year if you provide evidence that you have been actively looking for a job, and there is reason to think you have a real chance of finding a job. During this period, you are entitled to a short-term residence permit valid for six months provided that you are registered in an employment centre. See below for more information on specific types of work permits. In June 2016 the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. It will remain an EU member while negotiations, which will include the free movement of people, are carried out. British citizens already living in Switzerland before Brexit will continue to enjoy the same residency rights as before. But the situation for new British nationals coming to Switzerland post-Brexit hinges on whether Britain leaves the EU with a deal or not. If there is no deal, then Switzerland will impose a quota of 3,500 British nationals who can come to Switzerland to work. The British embassy to Switzerland is keeping in touch with its nationals in Switzerland on areas of Brexit that are still not yet clear. More information on working in Switzerland as an EU/EFTA national can be found here. Workers from all other states \textendash{} third states, as they are referred to \textendash{} are admitted in limited numbers to the labour market in Switzerland if they are well qualified. Switzerland makes available about 8,500 B and L work permits annually to people from outside the EU. Britain will be considered a third state if it exits from the EU with no deal. The new quota of 3,500 British nationals (mentioned above) will apply in this case. Family members of an EU/EFTA permit holder are allowed to join them and reside in Switzerland as well, regardless of nationality. Family members include a spouse, descendants under 21 or parent(s) and grandparent(s), provided that they financially depend on the permit holder. Cantonal authorities are responsible for issuing permits. For more information, please visit the State Secretariat for Migration. EU/EFTA nationals EU/EFTA citizens can benefit from agreements on the free movement of people that were put into force in 2002 and subsequently updated and extended to new member states. The agreements, in general, allow those citizens the right to enter, reside and look for work or to establish themselves as self-employed. For specific information regarding your particular EU/EFTA country, visit the State Secretariat for Migration. Citizens of Bulgaria and Romania have enjoyed the same rights on trial since 1 June 2016. However, a safeguard clause allows Switzerland to reintroduce quotas for a specified period if immigration exceeds a certain threshold. The Swiss government invoked this clause from June 1, 2017, and has extended it until May 31, 2019, after which Romanian and Bulgarian nationals will enjoy full freedom of movement. Special transitory measures currently apply to Croatian nationals with regard to quotas and work permits. In response to the successful public vote on February 9, 2014 demanding a limit on workers from the EU/EFTA, the Swiss authorities have introduced a measure to favour hiring Swiss over non-Swiss people. Employers for certain categories of jobs, which have above-average unemployment rates and have been selected by the economic ministry, are obliged to advertise at local unemployment offices until December 31, 2019. The main work permits for EU/EFTA nationals can be broken down into several categories and are defined by letters. Here's what they mean: L: Short-term residents EU-27/EFTA nationals are entitled to an L permit provided they are in possession of an employment contract valid from three up to twelve months. More information on the permit can be found here. B: Resident foreign nationals This residence permit is granted to persons who have an unlimited employment relationship or one lasting for at least 12 months. It has a period of validity of five years and will be automatically extended for five years as long as the employment relationship continues. That said, the extension may be limited to one year if the person is unemployed for longer than 12 consecutive months. Persons who settle in the country without gainful employment (provided they have enough financial backing) also receive a B permit. EU/EFTA nationals wishing to be self-employed can get a B permit valid for five years provided they can prove they can make ends meet being self-employed. C: Settled foreign nationals Nationals from EU/EFTA countries can get a C permit, valid for an indefinite length, usually after a regular and uninterrupted stay of five years in Switzerland. However, according to the State Secretariat for Migration, ``The right to settle in Switzerland is not subject to any time restrictions or conditions. The State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) determines the earliest date from which the competent national authorities may grant settlement permits.'' This C permit allows holders to freely change where they live (cantons) and employers. More information on this permit can be found here. G: Cross-border commuters EU/EFTA cross-border commuters are nationals of EU/EFTA member states who reside in an EU/EFTA member state and work in Switzerland (either in an employed or self-employed capacity). All cross-border commuters must return to their main place of residence abroad at least once a week. More information on these permits is available here. Non EU/EFTA Nationals Workers from so-called third states - nationals from neither EU/EFTA member states nor Switzerland - must hold a work permit. Regulations on how to get one are considerably tighter than for most Europeans and are often directly tied to employment. Getting a job offer is just one step of many towards getting a permit. A third state national can take a job in Switzerland only if a person cannot be hired from within the Swiss labour market or an EU/EFTA state. Employers must show that they made ``intensive efforts'' to find a Swiss, EU/EFTA citizen or any foreign national already in Switzerland with a permit to work. Moreover, employers must show why those with priority who applied were not suitable for the job. Those with the best chances of being granted a permit include managers, specialists and other highly qualified people, meaning those with university degrees and professional experience. Applicants may also be required to know one of the official languages (German, French and Italian). Joint ventures, temporary teaching positions, managerial or specialist transfers, highly qualified scientists, or certain jobs involving art and culture, among others, can also obtain work permits under special circumstances. There is no time limit on how long the procedure can take but, generally speaking, straightforward cases with proper documentation and little need for following up (such as transferring of a top manager) can take as little as three weeks. Other cases can last several months. Like those for EU/EFTA nationals, work permits for third state nationals can be broken down into several categories and are defined by letters. Here's what they mean: L: Short-term residence permit This permit may be granted to people working in Switzerland for typically up to one year. It is tied to the term of the employment contract and can be extended, in exceptional cases, to up to 24 months if the holder works for the same employer. Also considered as short-term stays are basic and continuing education and training in Switzerland. B: Initial residence permit This residence permit does not, as a rule, exceed one year the first time it is given. Normally, a B permit is renewed from one year to the next, provided there are no conflicting grounds, such as dependency on social welfare. There are a limited number of these permits, which are subject to quotas. It includes limitations on where the holder can live (in the canton that issued the permit) and is tied to the employer. Taxes are levied at source. C: Permanent residence permit After staying in Switzerland for ten uninterrupted years, nationals from third states may, in principle, obtain a C permit. Nationals from the US and Canada must stay for five uninterrupted years. A C permit holder can change employers freely and live in any canton. Taxes are no longer levied at source. Cantons are responsible for issuing permits, subject to federal approval. For detailed information on the application procedure (where to apply, which form to fill in, how long it takes etc.), please contact the relevant office. For more information on how the procedure works, please visit the State Secretariat for Migration. Promised a permit - now what? EU/EFTA citizens planning to live in Switzerland for more than three months and/or to work must notify authorities in the commune (municipality) where they plan to live within 14 days of arriving or before starting a job, whichever is earlier. All others have the same registration deadlines but they must take a few extra steps. Generally, if you are coming to Switzerland to work, your employer will handle visa arrangements before you enter the country. Once those arrangements are completed and before you leave for Switzerland, you will have to send your passport off to the relevant Swiss embassy or consulate in your home country, which will issue your visa. After arriving in Switzerland, you must notify the commune (municipality) where you will be living. Those authorities will forward your papers to cantonal authorities, which will issue the actual residence permit \textendash{} a small card much like a driver's licence. Only people from third states receiving permits L, B or C receive the permit in this new credit card format. Others receive the older, passport-style permit. When registering with the local commune, you will need to bring passports, passport photographs, an employment contract and proof of health insurance. There are very specific requirements that must be met and it is well worth your time to contact cantonal authorities for specific information on what you'll need to bring.},

Even if it is debatable whether the programme can be judged as a success in terms of the absolute number of Green Cards issued, it provides important insights into the long-term integration of migrants from third countries coming to Germany for employment purposes \textendash{} a matter where the Green Card programme was successful beyond the policy it was originally designed for. Using sequence and cluster analyses to examine the employment trajectories of some 1500 Green Card recipients who came to Germany reveals the personal, occupational and firm-specific characteristics that have contributed to successful integration. It emerges that the likelihood of a Green Card recipient becoming successfully integrated in the German labour market is quite high and grows with increasing establishment size. Other factors beneficial to integration are a moderate agreed wage, employment in a more technically-oriented occupation and in particular being of Central or Eastern European origin. Against the background of the current debate surrounding demographic change and the growing skill shortages, the results obtained in this paper provide indications as to how human capital that is in demand globally and is correspondingly mobile can be bound to the German labour market in the longer term.},

  abstract = {Child poverty has been widely discussed in Germany since the publication of the third official Poverty and Wealth Report of the German government in 2008 which\textemdash inter alia\textemdash focused on the situation of children and families. However, child poverty is not only caused by low household incomes and impacts of child poverty are not only restricted to financial consequences. The capability approach takes into account this multidimensionality of well-being and poverty of children. It conceptualizes human well-being as not only depending on financial means but also gives the same importance to the personal and social conversion factors which determine how far financial means can be converted into personal well-being. Before 2008 the capability approach had only been applied to the well-being of adults in Germany, but not specifically to the well-being of children. However, there are several reasons why a capability analysis for children will differ from a capability analysis for adults. Adults' capability sets comprise dimensions that are less relevant for small children while other valuable capabilities have to be added. Furthermore the capability set depends to a large extent on the age of the child. The paper focuses on a multidimensional poverty analysis in the capability perspective of 5\textendash 6 years old children. In the domains of ``Education/Leisure'', ``Health'', ``Social Participation'' and ``Income'' child poverty is measured by predefined indicators. The relationship to the social and personal conversion factors of the caretakers is then evaluated. Additionally, a multidimensional poverty measure is analyzed.},

The Human Development Index (HDI) and related composite indices have been widely criticized in the welfare economic literature, yet are still some of the most influential income-alternatives in the research and policy arena. What are the theoretical links that bridge the gap between these composite indices and the criticisms levelled at them? This paper introduces the ``preference index approach,'' a multidimensional measure bringing together the ``equivalence approach'' and the ``distance function'' in welfare economic theory. It retains convenient similarities with HDI-type composite indices, but assesses well-being in a way that reflects interpersonal differences in preferences between dimensions of well-being, whilst retaining comparability of well-being levels between individuals. The approach is applied empirically with data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) to estimate different preference types between well-being dimensions. The empirical application finds that preferences differ by age, education level and unemployment status, and finds a weaker preference for the health and income dimension within older groups. Across all groups, health is strongly prioritized over income. When preference heterogeneities are taken into account, the picture of well-being looks quite different than that painted by standard welfare measures.},

  abstract = {In reviewing the expanding body of work on the linkages between gender, mobility, migration and transnationalism in Gender, Place and Culture over the last decade, this article highlights three significant contributions. First, through critical engagement with transnationalism studies, the journal has produced a sophisticated and variegated strand of work on gender politics and multiple forms of migration and mobility. In this article, we focus primarily on mobility in terms of human movement across national borders, rural\textendash urban migration, as well as the `to-ing and fro-ing' that inform the embodied experiences of being here and there simultaneously as iterated in transnationalism studies [L. Basch, N.G. Schiller, and C.S. Blanc, Nations Unbound: Transnational Projects, Postcolonial Predicaments, and Deterritorialized Nation-States. London: Routledge, 1994]. A second area of strength lies in the coalescence of work providing insights into the connections between social reproduction in a globalising world and intimate forms of global mobility and migration. A third highlight relates to the mutually constitutive relationship between the construction of masculinities and masculinist ideologies, on the one hand, and migration, mobility and transnationalism, on the other. The article concludes with a discussion of two more embryonic areas which merit further development in the journal: the first concerns the social and geographical (im)mobilities implied in cross-border reproductive care1 and the global mobility and assemblage of body parts, while the second relates to the distinctive role that feminist geographers interested in migrations and mobilities can play in working collaboratively and transnationally across different worlds.},

The method constructs a multi-dimensional poverty index through principle component analysis using a range of poverty-related indicators. The method was tested in India, Kenya, Madagascar, and Nicaragua. Results from these studies support our belief that the method has a potential for assessing the extent to which the poorest are reached by targeted development projects, programs, or policy instruments.},

Few scholars have looked at this aspect in depth, beyond a mere recognition of the existence of so-called transnational kinship groups.

The aims of this article are threefold. First, to show the key role that women play in the maintenance of their families and transnational groups; attention is paid to their contribution to the interlocking spheres of productive work, kin work and caring work. Second, to draw attention to the differentiation of transnational practices among two different migrant groups. Third, to spell out some of the consequences that the transnationalisation of social life has for migrant women and their families. These considerations are based on an analysis of the everyday experiences of Moroccan and Filipino women residing in the Southern European city of Barcelona.},

  abstract = {This article examines the speed of the occupational adjustment of immigrants using Labour Force Surveys 2004 and 2005 from Statistics Netherlands. The analysis provides new evidence that immigrants start with jobs at the lower levels of skill distribution. Their occupational achievement improves significantly with the duration of residence. The extent of this initial disadvantage and the rate of adjustment vary across immigrant groups according to the transferability of skills associated with their cultural and linguistic distance from Dutch society as predicted by the theory of immigrant occupational mobility. Most notably, Turks and Moroccans face the greatest initial dip and achieve the highest rate of adjustment, while the opposite holds for Caribbean and Western immigrants. Our results are robust to three alternative measures of occupational status.},

  abstract = {For almost 50 years field experiments have been used to study ethnic and racial discrimination in hiring decisions, consistently reporting high rates of discrimination against minority applicants \textendash{} including immigrants \textendash{} irrespective of time, location, or minority groups tested. While Peter A. Riach and Judith Rich [2002. ``Field Experiments of Discrimination in the Market Place.'' The Economic Journal 112 (483): F480\textendash F518] and Judith Rich [2014. ``What Do Field Experiments of Discrimination in Markets Tell Us? A Meta Analysis of Studies Conducted since 2000.'' In Discussion Paper Series. Bonn: IZA] provide systematic reviews of existing field experiments, no study has undertaken a meta-analysis to examine the findings in the studies reported. In this article, we present a meta-analysis of 738 correspondence tests in 43 separate studies conducted in OECD countries between 1990 and 2015. In addition to summarising research findings, we focus on groups of specific tests to ascertain the robustness of findings, emphasising differences across countries, gender, and economic contexts. Moreover we examine patterns of discrimination, by drawing on the fact that the groups considered in correspondence tests and the contexts of testing vary to some extent. We focus on first- and second-generation immigrants, differences between specific minority groups, the implementation of EU directives, and the length of job application packs.},
